<p class='main'><hr/><span class="date">2014-03-07:</span> Steve Ballmer singing "Developers Developers Developers Developers!" at <a class="ext" href="http://YouTube.com/watch?v=KMU0tzLwhbE">YouTube.com/watch?v=KMU0tzLwhbE</a> reminds me of "<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers of the World Unite!".<br/>
<br/>
Contrast this with the message of "<a href="user.htm">User</a> <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom" from Saint IGNUcius.<br/>

<hr/><span class="date">2014-03-04:</span> I was thinking about how to implement the <a href="ccpp.htm">CCPP</a> website and realized the commitments must be stored in a distributed and group-verifiable manner similar to the approach used by bitcoin to validate transactions.<br/>

<hr/><span class="date">2014-03-03:</span> A month or so ago I was thinking about what it would take to create a fully counterbalanced elevator.&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine using a closed loop of cable with sand deposited or removed from platforms on the side opposite the cargo.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about this further, I realized each person moving into such an apartment building must make an initial 'deposit' by carrying enough sand to their floor needed to counterbalance their own body weight plus the weight of any other things such as furniture and groceries.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also noticed there is a 'lifecycle' for each item.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, a couch may stay in the apartment for years, but most groceries will be transformed into energy and waste <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we can use the waste <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t for counterbalance <small>(say transporting compost and trash and excrement to the ground level)</small>, then the tenant will only be required to make a weight deposit <small>(carry sand up the stairs)</small> in the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> that was transformed into energy.&nbsp;&nbsp;This pattern has some a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of application toward understanding economic systems.<br/>
<br/>
<hr/><span class="date">2014-03-03:</span> Thinking of representing <a href="ccpp.htm">CCPP</a> as re<a href="source.htm">source</a> preparation maybe similar to Tower Defense strategies.<br/>
