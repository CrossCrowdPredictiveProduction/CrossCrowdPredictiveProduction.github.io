<br/>
A <a href="product future.htm">Product Future</a> represents:<br/>
0. A <a href="product.htm">Product</a> of a projected quality and quantity at some rate across time.<br/>
1. The <a href="property.htm">Property</a> needed for that <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion held under the terms of the <a href="iota.htm">IOTA</a>.<br/>
2. The <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s needed for that <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion committed by qualified workers.<br/>
<br/>
This insures any <a href="product.htm">Product</a> for as much as the <a href="property.htm">Property</a> and <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s can be secured.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Examples</span><br/>
0. <a href="product.htm">Product</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp;One dozen grade A, medium chicken eggs every week.<br/>
1. <a href="property.htm">Property</a>: Co-ownership in land and tools etc. of a chicken farm and to grow feed.<br/>
2. <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s: Contractural agreements from all the people required to run a chicken farm.<br/>
<br/>
0. <a href="product.htm">Product</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Two rides on the west-side bus between 8am and 8pm every day.<br/>
1. <a href="property.htm">Property</a>: Co-ownership in bus and tools etc. to operate and maintain the bus fleet.<br/>
2. <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s: Contractural agreements from all the people required to operate and maintain the bus fleet.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Sharing <a href="property.htm">Property</a></span><br/>
<a href="good.htm">Good</a>s are preallocated when the <a href="user.htm">User</a>s commit <a href="property.htm">Property</a> toward <a href="future.htm">future</a> <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion.<br/>
For example, owning .13% of an orchard means you automatically own .13% of the fruit.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Swapping <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s</span><br/>
<a href="service.htm">Service</a>s are predictively scheduled when Workers commit <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s toward <a href="future.htm">future</a> <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion.<br/>
For example, picking 1.3 tons more fruit than needed to harvest your % of the orchard means you have done work for those other orchard co-owners.<br/>
<br/>
When used together, these two optimizations allow us to <br/>
<br/>
We can specialize without passing tokens and without resorting to troubles of traditional barter by trading <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s to work *before* <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion begins.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. A may commit to work for Ms. B in return for Ms. B committing to work for Mr. A.<br/>
<br/>
But more complex chains can also be arranged such as A works for B and B works for C and C works A, etc.<br/>
<br/>
As a worker, you may choose to sign such contracts for anyone willing to accept your expertise.&nbsp;&nbsp;These commitments are real investments.<br/>
<br/>
Other investments are commitments of Land or Capital, or whenever you pay <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> within the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>.<br/>
<br/>
As an Investor, you recieve full or partial <a href="product future.htm">Product Future</a>s as a combination of:<br/>
<br/>
1. Some % of co-ownership in the <a href="property.htm">property</a> for which you need the outputs.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, someone who drinks milk would want ownership in cattle while someone who uses honey would want ownership in bees.<br/>
<br/>
2. Commitments from other Workers within the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> to supply the labor needed to operate that <a href="property.htm">property</a> on your behalf.&nbsp;&nbsp;While you are fixing cars or painting buildings, those with which you have Swapped Skills will be milking cows and gathering honey.<br/>
<br/>
This gives us time to solve the "Simultaneous Coincidence of Wants" problem that faces typical barter, and nearly eliminates the need to use <a href="money.htm">money</a> at all, since the <a href="good.htm">good</a>s and <a href="service.htm">service</a>s we need are already the <a href="property.htm">property</a> of those who need them.<br/>
<br/>
Co-owners should advertise minimum allowable standards to avoid attracting workers unwilling to meet those constraints.<br/>
<br/>
Each <a href="product future.htm">Product Future</a> represents all *potential* <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion of those Physical assets, and so is much more powerful/valuable than a typical currency.<br/>
<br/>
It might be useful to also issue 'tickets' against <a href="future.htm">future</a> payout instances to more closely resemble typical currency.<br/>
<br/>
Each ticket would have a window of validity - where it could only be used after a starting time and before an ending time.<br/>
<br/>
Ideally the <a href="product future.htm">Product Future</a>s and tickets will be electronic, but this is not required.<br/>
<br/>
This accounting is important to defend ourselves against someone who might try to take more than they own.<br/>
<br/>
Each <a href="product future.htm">Product Future</a> represents the societal need as assessed by <a href="product.htm">Product</a> <a href="user.htm">user</a>s according to the full <a href="price.htm">price</a> paid - where paying up to cost indicates worth, and paying any a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> over cost indicates a desire to grow.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="product future.htm">Product Future</a>s are issued in response to any investment type, including when <a href="user.htm">user</a>s pay <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is accepted during the sale of <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a> and then offered back to that payer as unvested <a href="product future.htm">Product Future</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
The payers of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> gain <a href="property.htm">property</a> ownership in exactly the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> they pay above cost.&nbsp;&nbsp;This distributes control to those willing to pay for that growth so <a href="product.htm">Product</a>s become <a href="free.htm">Free</a> <small>(as in <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom)</small> for every <a href="user.htm">user</a>.<br/>
