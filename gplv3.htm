<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 3, 29 June 2007<br/>
<br/>
<a href="copy.htm">Copy</a>right <small>(C)</small> 2007 <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;<a class="ext" href="http://fsf.org/>">http://fsf.org/></a><br/>
<br/>
Everyone is permitted to <a href="copy.htm">copy</a> and distribute verbatim <a href="copi.htm">copi</a>es of this license document, but <a href="chang.htm">chang</a>ing it is not allowed.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preamble<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> General Public License is a <a href="free.htm">free</a>, <a href="copy.htm">copy</a>left license for software and other kinds of <a href="work.htm">work</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
The licenses for most software and other practical <a href="work.htm">work</a>s are designed to take away your <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom to <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e and <a href="chang.htm">chang</a>e the <a href="work.htm">work</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;By contrast, the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> General Public License is intended to guarantee your <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom to <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e and <a href="chang.htm">chang</a>e all versions of a program--to <a href="make.htm">make</a> sure it remains <a href="free.htm">free</a> software for all its <a href="user.htm">user</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="we.htm">We</a>, the <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software Foundation, <a href="use.htm">use</a> the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> General Public License for most of <a href="our.htm">our</a> software; it applies also to any other <a href="work.htm">work</a> released this way by its authors.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can apply it to your programs, too.<br/>
<br/>
When <a href="we.htm">we</a> speak of <a href="free.htm">free</a> software, <a href="we.htm">we</a> are referring to <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom, not <a href="price.htm">price</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="our.htm">Our</a> General Public Licenses are designed to <a href="make.htm">make</a> sure that you have the <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom to distribute <a href="copi.htm">copi</a>es of <a href="free.htm">free</a> software <small>(and <a href="charg.htm">charg</a>e for them if you wish)</small>, that you receive <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e <a href="code.htm">code</a> or can get it if you <a href="want.htm">want</a> it, that you can <a href="chang.htm">chang</a>e the software or <a href="use.htm">use</a> pieces of it in <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="free.htm">free</a> programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br/>
<br/>
To <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> your rights, <a href="we.htm">we</a> <a href="need.htm">need</a> to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute <a href="copi.htm">copi</a>es of the software, or if you <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify it: responsibilities to respect the <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom of others.<br/>
<br/>
For example, if you distribute <a href="copi.htm">copi</a>es of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you <a href="must.htm">must</a> <a href="pass.htm">pass</a> on to the recipients the same <a href="free.htm">free</a>doms that you received.&nbsp;&nbsp;You <a href="must.htm">must</a> <a href="make.htm">make</a> sure that they, too, receive or can get the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e <a href="code.htm">code</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;And you <a href="must.htm">must</a> show them these <a href="term.htm">term</a>s so they know their rights.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="dev.htm">Dev</a>elopers that <a href="use.htm">use</a> the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> your rights with two steps: <small>(1)</small> assert <a href="copy.htm">copy</a>right on the software, and <small>(2)</small> offer you this License giving you legal permission to <a href="copy.htm">copy</a>, distribute and/or <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify it.<br/>
<br/>
For the <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>elopers' and authors' <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ion, the <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> cl<a href="early.htm">early</a> explains that there is no warranty for this <a href="free.htm">free</a> software.&nbsp;&nbsp;For <a href="bot.htm">bot</a>h <a href="user.htm">user</a>s' and authors' sake, the <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> requires that <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified versions be marked as <a href="chang.htm">chang</a>ed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.<br/>
<br/>
Some <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>ices are designed to deny <a href="user.htm">user</a>s access to <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>all or run <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ing <a href="user.htm">user</a>s' <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom to <a href="chang.htm">chang</a>e the software.&nbsp;&nbsp;The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts for individuals to <a href="use.htm">use</a>, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, <a href="we.htm">we</a> have designed this version of the <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> to prohibit the practice for those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts.&nbsp;&nbsp;If such problems arise substantially in other domains, <a href="we.htm">we</a> stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in <a href="future.htm">future</a> versions of the <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a>, as <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed to <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> the <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom of <a href="user.htm">user</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&nbsp;&nbsp;States should not allow patents to restrict <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>elopment and <a href="use.htm">use</a> of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, <a href="we.htm">we</a> wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a <a href="free.htm">free</a> program could <a href="make.htm">make</a> it effectively proprietary.&nbsp;&nbsp;To prevent this, the <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> <a href="assur.htm">assur</a>es that patents cannot be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to render the program non-<a href="free.htm">free</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The precise <a href="term.htm">term</a>s and conditions for <a href="copy.htm">copy</a>ing, distribution and <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ification follow.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="term.htm">TERM</a>S AND CONDITIONS<br/>
<br/>
0. Definitions.<br/>
<br/>
“This License” refers to version 3 of the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> General Public License.<br/>
<br/>
“<a href="copy.htm">Copy</a>right” also <a href="means.htm">means</a> <a href="copy.htm">copy</a>right-like <a href="law.htm">law</a>s that apply to other kinds of <a href="work.htm">work</a>s, such as semiconductor masks.<br/>
<br/>
“The Program” refers to any <a href="copy.htm">copy</a>rightable <a href="work.htm">work</a> licensed under this License.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each licensee is addressed as “you”.&nbsp;&nbsp;“Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nizations.<br/>
<br/>
To “<a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify” a <a href="work.htm">work</a> <a href="means.htm">means</a> to <a href="copy.htm">copy</a> from or adapt all or part of the <a href="work.htm">work</a> in a fashion requiring <a href="copy.htm">copy</a>right permission, other than the making of an exact <a href="copy.htm">copy</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The resulting <a href="work.htm">work</a> is called a “<a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified version” of the earlier <a href="work.htm">work</a> or a <a href="work.htm">work</a> “based on” the earlier <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
A “covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>” <a href="means.htm">means</a> either the unmodified Program or a <a href="work.htm">work</a> based on the Program.<br/>
<br/>
To “propagate” a <a href="work.htm">work</a> <a href="means.htm">means</a> to do anything with it that, without permission, would <a href="make.htm">make</a> you directly or s<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>darily liable for infringement under applicable <a href="copy.htm">copy</a>right <a href="law.htm">law</a>, except executing it on a computer or <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ifying a private <a href="copy.htm">copy</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Propagation includes <a href="copy.htm">copy</a>ing, distribution <small>(with or without <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ification)</small>, making available to the public, and in some countries other <a href="act.htm">act</a>ivities as well.<br/>
<br/>
To “convey” a <a href="work.htm">work</a> <a href="means.htm">means</a> any kind of propagation that enables other parties to <a href="make.htm">make</a> or receive <a href="copi.htm">copi</a>es.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mere interaction with a <a href="user.htm">user</a> through a computer net<a href="work.htm">work</a>, with no <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>fer of a <a href="copy.htm">copy</a>, is not conveying.<br/>
<br/>
An interactive <a href="user.htm">user</a> interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that <small>(1)</small> displays an appropriate <a href="copy.htm">copy</a>right notice, and <small>(2)</small> tells the <a href="user.htm">user</a> that there is no warranty for the <a href="work.htm">work</a> <small>(except to the extent that warranties are provided)</small>, that licensees may convey the <a href="work.htm">work</a> under this License, and how to view a <a href="copy.htm">copy</a> of this License.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the interface presents a list of <a href="user.htm">user</a> commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br/>
1. <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e <a href="code.htm">Code</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The “<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e <a href="code.htm">code</a>” for a <a href="work.htm">work</a> <a href="means.htm">means</a> the preferred form of the <a href="work.htm">work</a> for making <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ifications to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;“<a href="object.htm">Object</a> <a href="code.htm">code</a>” <a href="means.htm">means</a> any non-<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e form of a <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
A “Standard Interface” <a href="means.htm">means</a> an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming <a href="lang.htm">lang</a>uage, one that is widely <a href="use.htm">use</a>d among <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>elopers <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing in that <a href="lang.htm">lang</a>uage.<br/>
<br/>
The “System Libraries” of an executable <a href="work.htm">work</a> include anything, other than the <a href="work.htm">work</a> as a whole, that <small>(a)</small> is included in the normal form of <a href="pack.htm">pack</a>aging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and <small>(b)</small> <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>es only to enable <a href="use.htm">use</a> of the <a href="work.htm">work</a> with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e <a href="code.htm">code</a> form.&nbsp;&nbsp;A “Major Component”, in this con<a href="text.htm">text</a>, <a href="means.htm">means</a> a major essential component <small>(kernel, <a href="window.htm">window</a> system, and so on)</small> of the specific operating system <small>(if any)</small> on which the executable <a href="work.htm">work</a> runs, or a compiler <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e the <a href="work.htm">work</a>, or an <a href="object.htm">object</a> <a href="code.htm">code</a> interpreter <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to run it.<br/>
<br/>
The “Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e” for a <a href="work.htm">work</a> in <a href="object.htm">object</a> <a href="code.htm">code</a> form <a href="means.htm">means</a> all the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e <a href="code.htm">code</a> <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed to generate, <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>all, and <small>(for an executable <a href="work.htm">work</a>)</small> run the <a href="object.htm">object</a> <a href="code.htm">code</a> and to <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify the <a href="work.htm">work</a>, including scripts to <a href="control.htm">control</a> those <a href="act.htm">act</a>ivities.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it does not include the <a href="work.htm">work</a>'s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available <a href="free.htm">free</a> programs which are <a href="use.htm">use</a>d unmodified in performing those <a href="act.htm">act</a>ivities but which are not part of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e includes interface definition files associated with <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e files for the <a href="work.htm">work</a>, and the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e <a href="code.htm">code</a> for <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>ed libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the <a href="work.htm">work</a> is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ication or <a href="control.htm">control</a> flow between those subprograms and other parts of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e <a href="need.htm">need</a> not include anything that <a href="user.htm">user</a>s can regenerate <a href="auto.htm">auto</a>matically from other parts of the Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
The Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e for a <a href="work.htm">work</a> in <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e <a href="code.htm">code</a> form is that same <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
2. Basic Permissions.<br/>
<br/>
All rights granted under this License are granted for the <a href="term.htm">term</a> of <a href="copy.htm">copy</a>right on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.&nbsp;&nbsp;This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="output.htm">output</a> from running a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> is covered by this License only if the <a href="output.htm">output</a>, given its content, constitutes a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This License acknowledges your rights of fair <a href="use.htm">use</a> or other equivalent, as provided by <a href="copy.htm">copy</a>right <a href="law.htm">law</a>.<br/>
<br/>
You may <a href="make.htm">make</a>, run and propagate covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>s that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.&nbsp;&nbsp;You may convey covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>s to others for the sole purpose of having them <a href="make.htm">make</a> <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those <a href="work.htm">work</a>s, provided that you comply with the <a href="term.htm">term</a>s of this License in conveying all <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ial for which you do not <a href="control.htm">control</a> <a href="copy.htm">copy</a>right.&nbsp;&nbsp;Those thus making or running the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>s for you <a href="must.htm">must</a> do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and <a href="control.htm">control</a>, on <a href="term.htm">term</a>s that prohibit them from making any <a href="copi.htm">copi</a>es of your <a href="copy.htm">copy</a>righted <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ial outside their relationship with you.<br/>
<br/>
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 <a href="make.htm">make</a>s it unnecessary.<br/>
3. <a href="protect.htm">Protect</a>ing <a href="user.htm">User</a>s' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention <a href="law.htm">Law</a>.<br/>
<br/>
No covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable <a href="law.htm">law</a> fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO <a href="copy.htm">copy</a>right treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar <a href="law.htm">law</a>s prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.<br/>
<br/>
When you convey a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ification of the <a href="work.htm">work</a> as a <a href="means.htm">means</a> of enforcing, aga<a href="inst.htm">inst</a> the <a href="work.htm">work</a>'s <a href="user.htm">user</a>s, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.<br/>
4. Conveying Verbatim <a href="copi.htm">Copi</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
You may convey verbatim <a href="copi.htm">copi</a>es of the Program's <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e <a href="code.htm">code</a> as you receive it, in any <a href="mediu.htm">mediu</a>m, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each <a href="copy.htm">copy</a> an appropriate <a href="copy.htm">copy</a>right notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive <a href="term.htm">term</a>s added in accord with section 7 apply to the <a href="code.htm">code</a>; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a <a href="copy.htm">copy</a> of this License along with the Program.<br/>
<br/>
You may <a href="charg.htm">charg</a>e any <a href="price.htm">price</a> or no <a href="price.htm">price</a> for each <a href="copy.htm">copy</a> that you convey, and you may offer sup<a href="port.htm">port</a> or warranty <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ion for a fee.<br/>
5. Conveying <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>ified <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e Versions.<br/>
<br/>
You may convey a <a href="work.htm">work</a> based on the Program, or the <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ifications to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e it from the Program, in the form of <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e <a href="code.htm">code</a> under the <a href="term.htm">term</a>s of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * a)</small> The <a href="work.htm">work</a> <a href="must.htm">must</a> <a href="carry.htm">carry</a> prominent notices stating that you <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified it, and giving a relevant date.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * b)</small> The <a href="work.htm">work</a> <a href="must.htm">must</a> <a href="carry.htm">carry</a> prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;This requirement <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * c)</small> You <a href="must.htm">must</a> license the entire <a href="work.htm">work</a>, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a <a href="copy.htm">copy</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional <a href="term.htm">term</a>s, to the whole of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>, and all its parts, regardless of how they are <a href="pack.htm">pack</a>aged.&nbsp;&nbsp;This License gives no permission to license the <a href="work.htm">work</a> in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * d)</small> If the <a href="work.htm">work</a> has interactive <a href="user.htm">user</a> interfaces, each <a href="must.htm">must</a> display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your <a href="work.htm">work</a> <a href="need.htm">need</a> not <a href="make.htm">make</a> them do so.<br/>
<br/>
A compilation of a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> with other separate and independent <a href="work.htm">work</a>s, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution <a href="mediu.htm">mediu</a>m, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting <a href="copy.htm">copy</a>right are not <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's <a href="user.htm">user</a>s beyond what the individual <a href="work.htm">work</a>s permit.&nbsp;&nbsp;Inclusion of a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.<br/>
6. Conveying Non-<a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e Forms.<br/>
<br/>
You may convey a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> in <a href="object.htm">object</a> <a href="code.htm">code</a> form under the <a href="term.htm">term</a>s of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e under the <a href="term.htm">term</a>s of this License, in one of these ways:<br/>

<br/>
If you convey an <a href="object.htm">object</a> <a href="code.htm">code</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a> under this section in, or with, or specifically for <a href="use.htm">use</a> in, a <a href="user.htm">User</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t, and the conveying occurs as part of a <a href="trans.htm">trans</a><a href="act.htm">act</a>ion in which the right of possession and <a href="use.htm">use</a> of the <a href="user.htm">User</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t is <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>ferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed <a href="term.htm">term</a> <small>(regardless of how the <a href="trans.htm">trans</a><a href="act.htm">act</a>ion is characterized)</small>, the Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e conveyed under this section <a href="must.htm">must</a> be accompanied by the <a href="inst.htm">Inst</a>allation <a href="info.htm">Info</a>rmation.&nbsp;&nbsp;But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>all <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified <a href="object.htm">object</a> <a href="code.htm">code</a> on the <a href="user.htm">User</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t <small>(for example, the <a href="work.htm">work</a> has been <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>alled in ROM)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
The requirement to provide <a href="inst.htm">Inst</a>allation <a href="info.htm">Info</a>rmation does not include a requirement to continue to provide sup<a href="port.htm">port</a> <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ice, warranty, or updates for a <a href="work.htm">work</a> that has been <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified or <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>alled by the recipient, or for the <a href="user.htm">User</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t in which it has been <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified or <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>alled.&nbsp;&nbsp;Access to a net<a href="work.htm">work</a> may be denied when the <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ification itself <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ially and adversely affects the operation of the net<a href="work.htm">work</a> or vio<a href="late.htm">late</a>s the rules and protocols for <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ication a<a href="cross.htm">cross</a> the net<a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>

7. Additional <a href="term.htm">Term</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
“Additional permissions” are <a href="term.htm">term</a>s that supplement the <a href="term.htm">term</a>s of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable <a href="law.htm">law</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br/>
<br/>
When you convey a <a href="copy.htm">copy</a> of a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that <a href="copy.htm">copy</a>, or from any part of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>(Additional permissions may be written to require their <a href="own.htm">own</a> removal in certain cases when you <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify the <a href="work.htm">work</a>.)</small> You may place additional permissions on <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ial, added by you to a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, for which you have or can give appropriate <a href="copy.htm">copy</a>right permission.<br/>
<br/>
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ial you add to a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, you may <small>(if authorized by the <a href="copy.htm">copy</a>right <a href="hold.htm">hold</a>ers of that <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ial)</small> supplement the <a href="term.htm">term</a>s of this License with <a href="term.htm">term</a>s:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * a)</small> Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability diffe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ly from the <a href="term.htm">term</a>s of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * b)</small> Requiring pre<a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ial or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by <a href="work.htm">work</a>s containing it; or<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * c)</small> Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ial, or requiring that <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified versions of such <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ial be marked in reasonable ways as diffe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> from the original version; or<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * d)</small> Limiting the <a href="use.htm">use</a> for publicity purposes of <a href="name.htm">name</a>s of licensors or authors of the <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ial; or<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * e)</small> Declining to grant rights under <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>emark <a href="law.htm">law</a> for <a href="use.htm">use</a> of some <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e <a href="name.htm">name</a>s, <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>emarks, or <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ice marks; or<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * f)</small> Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ial by anyone who conveys the <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ial <small>(or <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified versions of it)</small> with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.<br/>
<br/>
All other non-permissive additional <a href="term.htm">term</a>s are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a <a href="term.htm">term</a> that is a further restriction, you may remove that <a href="term.htm">term</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ial governed by the <a href="term.htm">term</a>s of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br/>
<br/>
If you add <a href="term.htm">term</a>s to a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> in accord with this section, you <a href="must.htm">must</a> place, in the relevant <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e files, a statement of the additional <a href="term.htm">term</a>s that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable <a href="term.htm">term</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
Additional <a href="term.htm">term</a>s, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.<br/>
8. <a href="term.htm">Term</a>ination.<br/>
<br/>
You may not propagate or <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> except as expressly provided under this License.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any attempt otherwise to propagate or <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify it is void, and will <a href="auto.htm">auto</a>matically <a href="term.htm">term</a>inate your rights under this License <small>(including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular <a href="copy.htm">copy</a>right <a href="hold.htm">hold</a>er is re<a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ated <small>(a)</small> provisionally, unless and until the <a href="copy.htm">copy</a>right <a href="hold.htm">hold</a>er explicitly and finally <a href="term.htm">term</a>inates your license, and <small>(b)</small> permanently, if the <a href="copy.htm">copy</a>right <a href="hold.htm">hold</a>er fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable <a href="means.htm">means</a> prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, your license from a particular <a href="copy.htm">copy</a>right <a href="hold.htm">hold</a>er is re<a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ated permanently if the <a href="copy.htm">copy</a>right <a href="hold.htm">hold</a>er notifies you of the violation by some reasonable <a href="means.htm">means</a>, this is the first <a href="time.htm">time</a> you have received notice of violation of this License <small>(for any <a href="work.htm">work</a>)</small> from that <a href="copy.htm">copy</a>right <a href="hold.htm">hold</a>er, and you <a href="cur.htm">cur</a>e the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="term.htm">Term</a>ination of your rights under this section does not <a href="term.htm">term</a>inate the licenses of parties who have received <a href="copi.htm">copi</a>es or rights from you under this License.&nbsp;&nbsp;If your rights have been <a href="term.htm">term</a>inated and not permanently re<a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ated, you do not qualify to receive <a href="new.htm">new</a> licenses for the same <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ial under section 10.<br/>
9. Acceptance Not Required for Having <a href="copi.htm">Copi</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a <a href="copy.htm">copy</a> of the Program.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ancillary propagation of a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>mission to receive a <a href="copy.htm">copy</a> likewise does not require acceptance.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify any covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;These <a href="act.htm">act</a>ions infringe <a href="copy.htm">copy</a>right if you do not accept this License.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, by <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ifying or propagating a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br/>
10. <a href="auto.htm">Auto</a>matic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br/>
<br/>
Each <a href="time.htm">time</a> you convey a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, the recipient <a href="auto.htm">auto</a>matically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify and propagate that <a href="work.htm">work</a>, subject to this License.&nbsp;&nbsp;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br/>
<br/>
An “entity <a href="trans.htm">trans</a><a href="act.htm">act</a>ion” is a <a href="trans.htm">trans</a><a href="act.htm">act</a>ion <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>ferring <a href="control.htm">control</a> of an <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization, or substantially all <a href="asset.htm">asset</a>s of one, or subdividing an <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization, or merging <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;If propagation of a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> results from an entity <a href="trans.htm">trans</a><a href="act.htm">act</a>ion, each party to that <a href="trans.htm">trans</a><a href="act.htm">act</a>ion who receives a <a href="copy.htm">copy</a> of the <a href="work.htm">work</a> also receives whatever licenses to the <a href="work.htm">work</a> the party's predecessor in <a href="interest.htm">interest</a> had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e of the <a href="work.htm">work</a> from the predecessor in <a href="interest.htm">interest</a>, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br/>
<br/>
You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other <a href="charg.htm">charg</a>e for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation <small>(including a <a href="cross.htm">cross</a>-claim or counterclaim in a <a href="law.htm">law</a>suit)</small> alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, <a href="sell.htm">sell</a>ing, offering for sale, or im<a href="port.htm">port</a>ing the Program or any <a href="port.htm">port</a>ion of it.<br/>
11. Patents.<br/>
<br/>
A “contributor” is a <a href="copy.htm">copy</a>right <a href="hold.htm">hold</a>er who authorizes <a href="use.htm">use</a> under this License of the Program or a <a href="work.htm">work</a> on which the Program is based.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="work.htm">work</a> thus licensed is called the contributor's “contributor version”.<br/>
<br/>
A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed or <a href="control.htm">control</a>led by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or <a href="sell.htm">sell</a>ing its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ification of the contributor version.&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of this definition, “<a href="control.htm">control</a>” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.<br/>
<br/>
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-<a href="free.htm">free</a> patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to <a href="make.htm">make</a>, <a href="use.htm">use</a>, <a href="sell.htm">sell</a>, offer for sale, im<a href="port.htm">port</a> and otherwise run, <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br/>
<br/>
In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment or <a href="commit.htm">commit</a>ment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent <small>(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement)</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;To “grant” such a patent license to a party <a href="means.htm">means</a> to <a href="make.htm">make</a> such an <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment or <a href="commit.htm">commit</a>ment not to enforce a patent aga<a href="inst.htm">inst</a> the party.<br/>
<br/>
If you convey a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e of the <a href="work.htm">work</a> is not available for anyone to <a href="copy.htm">copy</a>, <a href="free.htm">free</a> of <a href="charg.htm">charg</a>e and under the <a href="term.htm">term</a>s of this License, through a publicly available net<a href="work.htm">work</a> <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>er or other readily accessible <a href="means.htm">means</a>, then you <a href="must.htm">must</a> either <small>(1)</small> cause the Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e to be so available, or <small>(2)</small> arrange to deprive yourself of the <a href="bene.htm">bene</a>fit of the patent license for this particular <a href="work.htm">work</a>, or <small>(3)</small> arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients.&nbsp;&nbsp;“Knowingly relying” <a href="means.htm">means</a> you have <a href="act.htm">act</a>ual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> in a country, or your recipient's <a href="use.htm">use</a> of the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br/>
<br/>
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single <a href="trans.htm">trans</a><a href="act.htm">act</a>ion or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> authorizing them to <a href="use.htm">use</a>, propagate, <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify or convey a specific <a href="copy.htm">copy</a> of the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, then the patent license you grant is <a href="auto.htm">auto</a>matically extended to all recipients of the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> and <a href="work.htm">work</a>s based on it.<br/>
<br/>
A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License.&nbsp;&nbsp;You may not convey a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you <a href="make.htm">make</a> <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment to the third party based on the extent of your <a href="act.htm">act</a>ivity of conveying the <a href="work.htm">work</a>, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> from you, a discriminatory patent license <small>(a)</small> in connection with <a href="copi.htm">copi</a>es of the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> conveyed by you <small>(or <a href="copi.htm">copi</a>es made from those <a href="copi.htm">copi</a>es)</small>, or <small>(b)</small> primarily for and in connection with specific <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts or compilations that contain the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent <a href="law.htm">law</a>.<br/>
12. No Surrender of Others' <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom.<br/>
<br/>
If conditions are imposed on you <small>(whether by court order, <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment or otherwise)</small> that con<a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you cannot convey a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if you <a href="agree.htm">agree</a> to <a href="term.htm">term</a>s that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy <a href="bot.htm">bot</a>h those <a href="term.htm">term</a>s and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br/>
13. <a href="use.htm">Use</a> with the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> Affero General Public License.<br/>
<br/>
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> with a <a href="work.htm">work</a> licensed under version 3 of the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> Affero General Public License into a single combined <a href="work.htm">work</a>, and to convey the resulting <a href="work.htm">work</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="term.htm">term</a>s of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, but the special requirements of the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a net<a href="work.htm">work</a> will apply to the combination as such.<br/>
14. Revised Versions of this License.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software Foundation may publish revised and/or <a href="new.htm">new</a> versions of the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> General Public License from <a href="time.htm">time</a> to <a href="time.htm">time</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such <a href="new.htm">new</a> versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address <a href="new.htm">new</a> problems or concerns.<br/>
<br/>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> General Public License “or any <a href="late.htm">late</a>r version” applies to it, you have the option of following the <a href="term.htm">term</a>s and conditions either of that numbered version or of any <a href="late.htm">late</a>r version published by the <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software Foundation.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Program does not specify a version number of the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software Foundation.<br/>
<br/>
If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which <a href="future.htm">future</a> versions of the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> General Public License can be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="late.htm">Late</a>r license versions may give you additional or diffe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> permissions.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or <a href="copy.htm">copy</a>right <a href="hold.htm">hold</a>er as a result of your choosing to follow a <a href="late.htm">late</a>r version.<br/>
15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br/>
<br/>
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE <a href="law.htm">LAW</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE <a href="copy.htm">COPY</a>RIGHT <a href="hold.htm">HOLD</a>ERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp;&nbsp;THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.&nbsp;&nbsp;SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE <a href="cost.htm">COST</a> OF ALL NECESSARY <a href="serv.htm">SERV</a>ICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br/>
16. Limitation of Liability.<br/>
<br/>
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE <a href="law.htm">LAW</a> OR <a href="agree.htm">AGREE</a>D TO IN WRITING WILL ANY <a href="copy.htm">COPY</a>RIGHT <a href="hold.htm">HOLD</a>ER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO <a href="mod.htm">MOD</a>IFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE <a href="use.htm">USE</a> OR INABILITY TO <a href="use.htm">USE</a> THE PROGRAM <small>(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS)</small>, EVEN IF SUCH <a href="hold.htm">HOLD</a>ER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br/>
17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br/>
<br/>
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their <a href="term.htm">term</a>s, reviewing courts shall apply local <a href="law.htm">law</a> that most closely approximates an ab<a href="solu.htm">solu</a>te waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a <a href="copy.htm">copy</a> of the Program in <a href="return.htm">return</a> for a fee.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END OF <a href="term.htm">TERM</a>S AND CONDITIONS<br/>
<br/>
How to Apply These <a href="term.htm">Term</a>s to Your <a href="new.htm">New</a> Programs<br/>
<br/>
If you <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>elop a <a href="new.htm">new</a> program, and you <a href="want.htm">want</a> it to be of the greatest possible <a href="use.htm">use</a> to the public, the best way to achieve this is to <a href="make.htm">make</a> it <a href="free.htm">free</a> software which everyone can redistribute and <a href="chang.htm">chang</a>e under these <a href="term.htm">term</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "<a href="copy.htm">copy</a>right" line and a <a href="point.htm">point</a>er to where the full notice is found.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;one line to give the program's <a href="name.htm">name</a> and a brief idea of what it does.><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="copy.htm">Copy</a>right <small>(C)</small> &lt;year>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;<a href="name.htm">name</a> of author><br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is <a href="free.htm">free</a> software: you can redistribute it and/or <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it under the <a href="term.htm">term</a>s of the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> General Public License as published by<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <small>(at your option)</small> any <a href="late.htm">late</a>r version.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is distributed in the hope that it will be <a href="use.htm">use</a>ful,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> General Public License for more details.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should have received a <a href="copy.htm">copy</a> of the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> General Public License<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; along with this program.&nbsp;&nbsp;If not, see &lt;<a class="ext" href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.</a><br/>
<br/>
Also add <a href="info.htm">info</a>rmation on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br/>
<br/>
If the program does <a href="term.htm">term</a>inal interaction, <a href="make.htm">make</a> it <a href="output.htm">output</a> a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>e:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;program>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="copy.htm">Copy</a>right <small>(C)</small> &lt;year>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;<a href="name.htm">name</a> of author><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program comes with AB<a href="solu.htm">SOLU</a>TELY NO WARRANTY; for details <a href="type.htm">type</a> `show w'.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is <a href="free.htm">free</a> software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under certain conditions; <a href="type.htm">type</a> `show c' for details.<br/>
<br/>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be diffe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>; for a GUI interface, you would <a href="use.htm">use</a> an "about box".<br/>
<br/>
You should also get your <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>er <small>(if you <a href="work.htm">work</a> as a programmer)</small> or school, if any, to sign a "<a href="copy.htm">copy</a>right disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. For more <a href="info.htm">info</a>rmation on this, and how to apply and follow the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a>, see &lt;<a class="ext" href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.</a><br/>
<br/>
The <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more <a href="use.htm">use</a>ful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you <a href="want.htm">want</a> to do, <a href="use.htm">use</a> the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> Lesser General Public License <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ead of this License.
