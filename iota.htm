<p class='main'><span class="rel">Related:</span> <a href="ccpp.htm">CCPP</a>, <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>, <a href="source.htm">Source</a>s, <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s, <a href="property.htm">Property</a>, <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a><br/>
<br/>
The <a href="iota.htm">IOTA</a> <small>(Intra Owner Trade Agreement)</small> is the legal binding social contract applied to <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>s designed to autodistribute growth to those who pay for it by treating some % of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as the payer's investment so all <a href="user.htm">user</a>s gain co-ownership in the <a href="source.htm">source</a>s used for the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts they need.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Rules</span><br/>
1. <a href="property.htm">Property</a> is the investor's right:<br/>
Those who invest <a href="property.htm">property</a> or <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s receive titles of real <a href="property.htm">property</a> ownership in the <a href="source.htm">source</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, under the terms of the <a href="iota.htm">IOTA</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any subgroup may secede for any arbitrary reason and retain their <a href="property.htm">property</a>.<br/>
<br/>
2. <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t is the owner's return:<br/>
Those who own <a href="source.htm">source</a>s are the natural owners of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts in that same a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is not sold <small>(except <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a>)</small> because it is already in the hands of those who need it.&nbsp;&nbsp;This eliminates the collection and payout of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> for those owners.<br/>
<br/>
3. <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a> is the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er's investment:<br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers become owners in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> when they commit to <a href="work.htm">work</a> in the future, but that <a href="property.htm">property</a> is contingent upon them meeting those goals, usually within a set timeframe.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is probably the most complicated part of the system because it requires the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> be horizontally diverse enough to supply at least basic goods and services such as food, shelter, sanitation, health-care, transportation, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;This compensates <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers without paying wages in the traditional sense.<br/>
<br/>
4. <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is the payer's investment:<br/>
Owners can charge <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> when selling <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts or renting <a href="source.htm">source</a>s, but must treat some % of that <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as an investment from the payer toward more <a href="source.htm">source</a>s that eventually vest to the person who paid so they also gain the <a href="source.htm">source</a>s needed to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e the goods and services they use.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Constraints</span><br/>
