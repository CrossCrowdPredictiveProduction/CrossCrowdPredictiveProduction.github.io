The <a href="iota.htm">IOTA</a> <small>(Intra-Owner Trade Agreement)</small> is the legal document applied to <a href="product future.htm">Product Future</a>s designed to autodistribute growth to those who pay for it by treating some % of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as the payer's investment so all users gain co-ownership in the <a href="property.htm">property</a> used for the <a href="product.htm">product</a>s they need.<br/>

<span class="h2">==Ruleset</span><br/>
0. Investors become real co-owners.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means those who invest <a href="property.htm">Property</a> or <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s become real co-owners in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some will invest <a href="money.htm">money</a> to buy <a href="property.htm">Property</a>, while others will invest <a href="future.htm">future</a> work as <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
1. <a href="product.htm">Product</a> is the investor's return.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means the <a href="product.htm">Product</a> is not sold <small>(except <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a>)</small> because it is already in the hands of those who need it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each investor spreads their investments across the various <a href="property.htm">Property</a> needed to produce the quality and quantity of <a href="product.htm">product</a>s they predict they will need.&nbsp;&nbsp;This eliminates the collection of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> and also eliminates the payout of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
2. <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>-to-work is an investment.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means some investors will commit to work in the <a href="future.htm">future</a> in return for co-ownership in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This eliminates the need for traditional wages.<br/>
<br/>
3. <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is the payer's investment.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means we will charge <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> against latecomers who buy <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a> <a href="product.htm">product</a> but treat at least some % of that <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as an investment in more <a href="property.htm">Property</a> that will finally vest to the consumer who paid it so that every consumer incrementally gains co-ownership in the <a href="property.htm">Property</a> needed to produce the <a href="product.htm">product</a>s they need.<br/>
<br/>
4. Secession is a protected right.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means any subgroup may secede for any arbitrary reason while retaining their portion of ownership that <a href="property.htm">Property</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an attempt to address the Tyranny of the Majority.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Constraints</span><br/>
As Consumer of some <a href="product.htm">Product</a> you MAY:<br/>
&nbsp; 0. Use this instance for any purpose.<br/>

&nbsp; 2. Copy this instance by renting or buying the <a href="property.htm">Property</a> needed for that <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion.&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>(YOU ARE ALREADY A CO-OWNER IF YOU PAID <a href="profit.htm">PROFIT</a>.)</small><br/>
&nbsp; 3. Share this instance or a copy - whether modified or not.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you share this object instance or a copy - whether modified or not, you MUST:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Accompany each instance with a copy of this document.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. Treat all <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> gained through the sale of this object or through the rental of <a href="property.htm">Property</a> as an investment from that user toward the purchase of more <a href="property.htm">Property</a>.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C. Issue <a href="product future.htm">Product Future</a>s against the <a href="property.htm">Property</a> bought with that <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> and vest those <a href="product future.htm">Product Future</a>s to the original payer.<br/>
