PREFACE<br/>
<br/>
One of the <a href="cur.htm">cur</a><a href="rent.htm">rent</a> <a href="object.htm">object</a>ions to <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ism, and Socialism altogether, is<br/>
that the idea is so <a href="old.htm">old</a>, and yet it has never been realized. Schemes of<br/>
ideal States haunted the thinkers of Ancient Greece; <a href="late.htm">late</a>r on, the <a href="early.htm">early</a><br/>
Christians <a href="join.htm">join</a>ed in <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ist <a href="group.htm">group</a>s; centuries <a href="late.htm">late</a>r, large <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ist<br/>
brotherhoods came into existence during the Reform movement. Then, the<br/>
same ideals were revived during the great English and French<br/>
Revolutions; and finally, quite <a href="late.htm">late</a>ly, in 1848, a revolution, inspired<br/>
to a great extent with Socialist ideals, took place in France. "And yet,<br/>
you see," <a href="we.htm">we</a> are told, "how far away is still the realization of your<br/>
schemes. Don't you think that there is some fundamental error in your<br/>
understanding of human nature and its <a href="need.htm">need</a>s?"<br/>
<br/>
At first sight this <a href="object.htm">object</a>ion seems very serious. However, the moment <a href="we.htm">we</a><br/>
consider human history more attentively, it loses its strength. <a href="we.htm">We</a> see,<br/>
first, that hundreds of millions of men have succeeded in maintaining<br/>
amongst themselves, in their village <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ities, for many hundreds of<br/>
years, one of the main elements of Socialism--the <a href="common.htm">common</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of<br/>
the chief <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>rument of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, the <a href="land.htm">land</a>, and the ap<a href="port.htm">port</a>ionment of<br/>
the same according to the labour capacities of the diffe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> families;<br/>
and <a href="we.htm">we</a> learn that if the <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>al possession of the <a href="land.htm">land</a> has been<br/>
destroyed in Western Europe, it was not from within, but from without,<br/>
by the governments which <a href="creat.htm">creat</a>ed a <a href="land.htm">land</a> monopoly in favour of the<br/>
nobility and the middle <a href="class.htm">class</a>es. <a href="we.htm">We</a> learn, moreover, that the medieval<br/>
cities succeeded in maintaining in their midst, for several centuries in<br/>
succession, a certain socialized <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e;<br/>
that these centuries were periods of a rapid intellectual, industrial,<br/>
and artistic progress; while the decay of these <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>al <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>itutions<br/>
came mainly from the incapacity of men of combining the village with the<br/>
city, the peasant with the citizen, so as <a href="join.htm">join</a>tly to oppose the <a href="grow.htm">grow</a>th<br/>
of the military states, which destroyed the <a href="free.htm">free</a> cities.<br/>
<br/>
The history of mankind, thus understood, does not offer, then, an<br/>
argument aga<a href="inst.htm">inst</a> <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ism. It appears, on the contrary, as a succession<br/>
of endeavours to realize some <a href="sort.htm">sort</a> of <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ist <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization, endeavours<br/>
which were crowned here and there with a partial success of a certain<br/>
duration; and all <a href="we.htm">we</a> are authorized to conclude is, that mankind has not<br/>
yet found the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a> form for combining, on <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>istic principles,<br/>
<a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture with a suddenly <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>eloped industry and a rapidly <a href="grow.htm">grow</a>ing<br/>
international <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e. The latter appears especially as a disturbing<br/>
element, since it is no longer individuals only, or cities, that enrich<br/>
themselves by distant <a href="commer.htm">commer</a>ce and ex<a href="port.htm">port</a>; but whole nations <a href="grow.htm">grow</a> rich<br/>
at the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of those nations which lag behind in their industrial<br/>
<a href="dev.htm">dev</a>elopment.<br/>
<br/>
These conditions, which began to appear by the end of the eighteenth<br/>
century, took, however, their full <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>elopment in the nineteenth century<br/>
only, after the Napoleonic wars came to an end. And <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ism has<br/>
to take them into account.<br/>
<br/>
It is now known that the French Revolution, apart from its political<br/>
significance, was an attempt made by the French people, in 1793 and<br/>
1794, in three diffe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> directions more or less akin to Socialism. It<br/>
was, first, _the equalization of fortunes_, by <a href="means.htm">means</a> of an income <a href="tax.htm">tax</a><br/>
and succession duties, <a href="bot.htm">bot</a>h heavily progressive, as also by a direct<br/>
confiscation of the <a href="land.htm">land</a> in order to sub-divide it, and by heavy war<br/>
<a href="tax.htm">tax</a>es levied upon the rich only. The s<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>d attempt was a <a href="sort.htm">sort</a> of<br/>
_Municipal <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ism_ as regards the <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>ption of some <a href="object.htm">object</a>s of<br/>
first necessity, bought by the municipalities, and <a href="sold.htm">sold</a> by them at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a><br/>
<a href="price.htm">price</a>. And the third attempt was to introduce a wide _national system of<br/>
rationally established <a href="price.htm">price</a>s of all commodities_, for which the real<br/>
<a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>erate <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s had to be taken into<br/>
account. The Convention <a href="work.htm">work</a>ed hard at this scheme, and had n<a href="early.htm">early</a><br/>
completed its <a href="work.htm">work</a>, when reaction took the upper hand.<br/>
<br/>
It was during this remarkable movement, which has never yet been<br/>
<a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ly studied, that <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern Socialism was born--Fourierism with<br/>
L'Ange, at Lyons, and authoritarian <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ism with Buonarroti, Babeuf,<br/>
and their comrades. And it was im<a href="media.htm">media</a>tely after the Great Revolution<br/>
that the three great theoretical founders of <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern Socialism--Fourier,<br/>
Saint Simon, and Robert Owen, as well as <a href="god.htm">God</a><a href="win.htm">win</a> <small>(the No-State<br/>
Socialism)</small>--came forward; while the secret <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ist societies,<br/>
originated from those of Buonarroti and Babeuf, gave their stamp to<br/>
militant, authoritarian <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ism for the next fifty years.<br/>
<br/>
To be correct, then, <a href="we.htm">we</a> <a href="must.htm">must</a> say that <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern Socialism is not yet a<br/>
hundred years <a href="old.htm">old</a>, and that, for the first half of these hundred years,<br/>
two nations only, which stood at the head of the industrial movement,<br/>
i.e., Britain and France, took part in its e<a href="labor.htm">labor</a>ation. <a href="bot.htm">Bot</a>h--bleeding<br/>
at that <a href="time.htm">time</a> from the terrible wounds inflicted upon them by fifteen<br/>
years of Napoleonic wars, and <a href="bot.htm">bot</a>h enveloped in the great European<br/>
reaction that had come from the East.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, it was only after the Revolution of July, 1830, in France, and<br/>
the Reform movement of 1830-1832 in this country, had begun to shake off<br/>
that terrible reaction, that the discussion of Socialism became possible<br/>
for a few years before the revolution of 1848. And it was during those<br/>
years that the aspirations of Fourier, St. Simon, and Robert Owen,<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>ed out by their followers, took a definite shape, and the diffe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a><br/>
schools of Socialism which exist nowadays were defined.<br/>
<br/>
In Britain, Robert Owen and his followers <a href="work.htm">work</a>ed out their schemes of<br/>
<a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ist villages, <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>cultural and industrial at the same <a href="time.htm">time</a>;<br/>
immense co-operative associations were <a href="star.htm">star</a>ted for <a href="creat.htm">creat</a>ing with their<br/>
dividends more <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ist colonies; and the Great Consolidated <a href="trad.htm">Trad</a>es'<br/>
Union was founded--the forerunner of <a href="bot.htm">bot</a>h the Labour Parties of <a href="our.htm">our</a><br/>
days and the International <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ing-men's Association.<br/>
<br/>
In France, the Fourierist Considérant issued his remarkable manifesto,<br/>
which contains, beautifully <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>eloped, all the theoretical<br/>
considerations upon the <a href="grow.htm">grow</a>th of <a href="capital.htm">Capital</a>ism, which are now described as<br/>
"Scientific Socialism." Proudhon <a href="work.htm">work</a>ed out his idea of Anarchism and<br/>
Mutualism, without State interference. Louis Blanc published his<br/>
_<a href="orga.htm">Orga</a>nization of Labour_, which became <a href="late.htm">late</a>r on the programme of<br/>
Lassalle. <a href="vid.htm">Vid</a>al in France and Lorenz Stein in Germany further <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>eloped,<br/>
in two remarkable <a href="work.htm">work</a>s, published in 1846 and 1847 respectively, the<br/>
theoretical conceptions of Considérant; and finally <a href="vid.htm">Vid</a>al, and<br/>
especially Pecqueur, <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>eloped in detail the system of Collectivism,<br/>
which the former <a href="want.htm">want</a>ed the National Assembly of 1848 to vote in the<br/>
shape of <a href="law.htm">law</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
However, there is one feature, <a href="common.htm">common</a> to all Socialist schemes of that<br/>
period, which <a href="must.htm">must</a> be <a href="note.htm">note</a>d. The three great founders of Socialism who<br/>
wrote at the dawn of the nineteenth century were so entranced by the<br/>
wide horizons which it <a href="open.htm">open</a>ed before them, that they looked upon it as a<br/>
<a href="new.htm">new</a> revelation, and upon themselves as upon the founders of a <a href="new.htm">new</a><br/>
religion. Socialism had to be a religion, and they had to regu<a href="late.htm">late</a> its<br/>
march, as the heads of a <a href="new.htm">new</a> church. Besides, writing during the period<br/>
of reaction which had followed the French Revolution, and seeing more<br/>
its failures than its successes, they did not trust the masses, and they<br/>
did not appeal to them for bringing about the <a href="chang.htm">chang</a>es which they thought<br/>
necessary. They put their faith, on the contrary, into some great ruler,<br/>
some Socialist Napoleon. He would understand the <a href="new.htm">new</a> revelation; he<br/>
would be convinced of its desirability by the successful experiments of<br/>
their phalansteries, or associations; and he would peacefully accomplish<br/>
by his <a href="own.htm">own</a> authority the revolution which would bring well-being and<br/>
happiness to mankind. A military genius, Napoleon, had just been ruling<br/>
Europe. Why should not a social genius come forward, <a href="carry.htm">carry</a> Europe with<br/>
him and <a href="trans.htm">trans</a><a href="late.htm">late</a> the <a href="new.htm">new</a> Gospel into life? That faith was rooted very<br/>
deep, and it stood for a long <a href="time.htm">time</a> in the way of Socialism; its traces<br/>
are even seen amongst <a href="us.htm">us</a>, down to the present day.<br/>
<br/>
It was only during the years 1840-48, when the approach of the<br/>
Revolution was felt everywhere, and the proletarians were beginning to<br/>
<a href="plant.htm">plant</a> the banner of Socialism on the barricades, that faith in the<br/>
people began to enter once more the hearts of the social schemers:<br/>
faith, on the one side, in Republican Democracy, and on the other side<br/>
in _<a href="free.htm">free</a>_ association, in the <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nizing powers of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing-men<br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
But then came the Revolution of February, 1848, the middle-<a href="class.htm">class</a><br/>
Republic, and--with it, shattered hopes. Four months only after the<br/>
proclamation of the Republic, the June <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>rection of the Paris<br/>
proletarians broke out, and it was crushed in blood. The wholesale<br/>
shooting of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing-men, the mass de<a href="port.htm">port</a>ations to <a href="new.htm">New</a> Guinea, and<br/>
finally the Napoleonian _coup d'êtat_ followed. The Socialists were<br/>
prosecuted with fury, and the weeding out was so terrible and so<br/>
thorough that for the next twelve or fifteen years the very traces of<br/>
Socialism disappeared; its literature vanished so completely that even<br/>
<a href="name.htm">name</a>s, once so familiar before 1848, were entirely forgotten; ideas<br/>
which were then <a href="cur.htm">cur</a><a href="rent.htm">rent</a>--the stock ideas of the Socialists before<br/>
1848--were so wiped out as to be taken, <a href="late.htm">late</a>r on, by <a href="our.htm">our</a> generation, for<br/>
<a href="new.htm">new</a> discoveries.<br/>
<br/>
However, when a <a href="new.htm">new</a> revival began, about 1866, when <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ism and<br/>
Collectivism once more came forward, it appeared that the conception as<br/>
to the <a href="means.htm">means</a> of their realization had undergone a deep <a href="chang.htm">chang</a>e. The <a href="old.htm">old</a><br/>
faith in Political Democracy was dying out, and the first principles<br/>
upon which the Paris <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing-men <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>d with the British <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e-unionists<br/>
and Owenites, when they met in 1862 and 1864, at London, was that "the<br/>
emancipation of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing-men <a href="must.htm">must</a> be accomplished by the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing-men<br/>
themselves." Upon another <a href="point.htm">point</a> they also were <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>d. It was that the<br/>
labour unions themselves would have to get <a href="hold.htm">hold</a> of the <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ruments of<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, and <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nize <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion themselves. The French idea of the<br/>
Fourierist and Mutualist "Association" thus <a href="join.htm">join</a>ed hands with Robert<br/>
Owen's idea of "The Great Consolidated <a href="trad.htm">Trad</a>es' Union," which was<br/>
extended now, so as to become an International <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ing-men's<br/>
Association.<br/>
<br/>
Again this <a href="new.htm">new</a> revival of Socialism lasted but a few years. Soon came<br/>
the war of 1870-71, the uprising of the Paris <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>e--and again the<br/>
<a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>elopment of Socialism was rendered impossible in France. But<br/>
while Germany accepted now from the hands of its German teachers, Marx<br/>
and Engels, the Socialism of the French "forty-eighters" that is, the<br/>
Socialism of Considérant and Louis Blanc, and the Collectivism of<br/>
Pecqueur,--France made a further step forward.<br/>
<br/>
In March, 1871, Paris had proclaimed that henceforward it would not wait<br/>
for the retardatory <a href="port.htm">port</a>ions of France: that it intended to <a href="star.htm">star</a>t within<br/>
its <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>e its <a href="own.htm">own</a> social <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>elopment.<br/>
<br/>
The movement was too short-lived to give any positive result. It<br/>
remained <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>alist only; it merely asserted the rights of the <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>e<br/>
to its full <a href="auto.htm">auto</a>nomy. But the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing-<a href="class.htm">class</a>es of the <a href="old.htm">old</a> International<br/>
saw at once its historical significance. They understood that the <a href="free.htm">free</a><br/>
<a href="commun.htm">commun</a>e would be henceforth the <a href="mediu.htm">mediu</a>m in which the ideas of <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern<br/>
Socialism may come to realization. The <a href="free.htm">free</a> agro-industrial <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>es, of<br/>
which so much was spoken in Eng<a href="land.htm">land</a> and France before 1848, <a href="need.htm">need</a> not be<br/>
small phalansteries, or small <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ities of 2000 <a href="person.htm">person</a>s. They <a href="must.htm">must</a> be<br/>
vast agglomerations, like Paris, or, still better, small territories.<br/>
These <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>es would federate to constitute nations in some cases, even<br/>
irrespectively of the present national frontiers <small>(like the Cinque <a href="port.htm">Port</a>s,<br/>
or the Hansa)</small>. At the same <a href="time.htm">time</a> large labour associations would come<br/>
into existence for the inter-<a href="commun.htm">commun</a>al <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ice of the railways, the<br/>
docks, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Such were the ideas which began vaguely to circu<a href="late.htm">late</a> after 1871 amongst<br/>
the thinking <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing-men, especially in the Latin countries. In some<br/>
such <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization, the details of which life itself would settle, the<br/>
labour circles saw the <a href="mediu.htm">mediu</a>m through which Socialist forms of life<br/>
could find a much easier realization than through the seizure of all<br/>
industrial <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty by the State, and the State <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization of<br/>
<a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture and industry.<br/>
<br/>
These are the ideas to which I have endeavoured to give a more or less<br/>
definite expression in this book.<br/>
<br/>
Looking back now at the years that have <a href="pass.htm">pass</a>ed since this book was<br/>
written, I can say in full conscience that its leading ideas <a href="must.htm">must</a> have<br/>
been correct. State Socialism has certainly made considerable progress.<br/>
State railways, State banking, and State <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e in spirits have been<br/>
introduced here and there. But every step made in this direction, even<br/>
though it resulted in the cheapening of a given commodity, was found to<br/>
be a <a href="new.htm">new</a> obstacle in the struggle of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing-men for their<br/>
emancipation. So that <a href="we.htm">we</a> find <a href="grow.htm">grow</a>ing amongst the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing-men,<br/>
especially in Western Europe, the idea that even the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing of such a<br/>
vast national <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty as a railway-net could be much better handled by<br/>
a Federated Union of railway <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>és, than by a State <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization.<br/>
<br/>
On the other side, <a href="we.htm">we</a> see that countless attempts have been made all<br/>
over Europe and America, the leading idea of which is, on the one side,<br/>
to get into the hands of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing-men themselves wide branches of<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, and, on the other side, to always widen in the cities the<br/>
circles of the functions which the city performs in the <a href="interest.htm">interest</a> of its<br/>
inhabitants. <a href="trad.htm">Trad</a>e-unionism, with a <a href="grow.htm">grow</a>ing tendency towards <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nizing<br/>
the diffe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>es internationally, and of being not only an<br/>
<a href="inst.htm">inst</a>rument for the improvement of the conditions of labour, but also of<br/>
becoming an <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization which might, at a given moment, take into its<br/>
hands the management of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion; Co-operation, <a href="bot.htm">bot</a>h for <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion<br/>
and for distribution, <a href="bot.htm">bot</a>h in industry and <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture, and attempts at<br/>
combining <a href="bot.htm">bot</a>h <a href="sort.htm">sort</a>s of co-operation in experimental colonies; and<br/>
finally, the immensely varied field of the so-called Municipal<br/>
Socialism--these are the three directions in which the greatest amount<br/>
of <a href="creat.htm">creat</a>ive power has been <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>eloped <a href="late.htm">late</a>ly.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, none of these may, in any degree, be taken as a substitute<br/>
for <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ism, or even for Socialism, <a href="bot.htm">bot</a>h of which imply the <a href="common.htm">common</a><br/>
possession of the <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ruments of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion. But <a href="we.htm">we</a> certainly <a href="must.htm">must</a> look<br/>
at all these attempts as upon _experiments_--like those which Owen,<br/>
Fourier, and Saint Simon tried in their colonies--experiments which<br/>
prepare human thought to conceive some of the practical forms in which a<br/>
<a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ist society might find its expression. The synthesis of all these<br/>
partial experiments will have to be made some day by the constructive<br/>
genius of some one of the civilized nations. But samples of the bricks<br/>
out of which the great synthetic building will have to be built, and<br/>
even samples of some of its rooms, are being prepared by the immense<br/>
effort of the constructive genius of man.<br/>

CHAPTER I<br/>

<br/>
I<br/>
<br/>
The human race has travelled a long way, since those remote ages when<br/>
men fashioned their rude implements of flint and lived on the precarious<br/>
spoils of hunting, leaving to their children for their only heritage a<br/>
<a href="shelter.htm">shelter</a> <a href="bene.htm">bene</a>ath the rocks, some poor utensils--and Nature, vast,<br/>
unknown, and terrific, with whom they had to fight for their wretched<br/>
existence.<br/>
<br/>
During the long succession of agitated ages which have elapsed since,<br/>
mankind has ne<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>heless amassed untold treasures. It has cleared the<br/>
<a href="land.htm">land</a>, dried the marshes, hewn down forests, made roads, pierced<br/>
mountains; it has been building, inventing, ob<a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ing, reasoning; it has<br/>
<a href="creat.htm">creat</a>ed a complex machinery, wrested her secrets from Nature, and<br/>
finally it pressed s<a href="team.htm">team</a> and electricity into its <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ice. And the<br/>
result is, that now the child of the civilized man finds at its birth,<br/>
ready for its <a href="use.htm">use</a>, an immense <a href="capital.htm">capital</a> accumu<a href="late.htm">late</a>d by those who have gone<br/>
before him. And this <a href="capital.htm">capital</a> enables man to acquire, merely by his <a href="own.htm">own</a><br/>
labour combined with the labour of others, riches sur<a href="pass.htm">pass</a>ing the dreams<br/>
of the fairy tales of the Thousand and One Nights.<br/>
<br/>
The soil is cleared to a great extent, fit for the reception of the best<br/>
seeds, ready to give a rich <a href="return.htm">return</a> for the <a href="skill.htm">skill</a> and labour spent upon<br/>
it--a <a href="return.htm">return</a> more than sufficient for all the <a href="want.htm">want</a>s of humanity. The<br/>
methods of rational cultivation are known.<br/>
<br/>
On the wide prairies of America each hundred men, with the aid of<br/>
powerful machinery, can <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e in a few months enough wheat to maintain<br/>
ten thousand people for a whole year. And where man wishes to double his<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e, to treble it, to multiply it a hundred-fold, he _<a href="make.htm">make</a>s_ the<br/>
soil, gives to each <a href="plant.htm">plant</a> the requisite care, and thus obtains enormous<br/>
<a href="return.htm">return</a>s. While the hunter of <a href="old.htm">old</a> had to scour fifty or sixty square<br/>
miles to find <a href="food.htm">food</a> for his family, the civilized man sup<a href="port.htm">port</a>s his<br/>
house<a href="hold.htm">hold</a>, with far less pains, and far more certainty, on a thousandth<br/>
part of that space. Climate is no longer an obstacle. When the <a href="sun.htm">sun</a><br/>
fails, man replaces it by artificial heat; and <a href="we.htm">we</a> see the coming of a<br/>
<a href="time.htm">time</a> when artificial light also will be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to stimu<a href="late.htm">late</a> vegetation.<br/>
Meanwhile, by the <a href="use.htm">use</a> of glass and hot <a href="water.htm">water</a> pipes, man renders a given<br/>
space ten and fifty <a href="time.htm">time</a>s more <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive than it was in its natural<br/>
state.<br/>
<br/>
The prodigies accomplished in industry are still more striking. With the<br/>
co-operation of those intelligent beings, <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern machines--themselves<br/>
the fruit of three or four generations of inventors, mostly unknown--a<br/>
hundred men manufacture now the stuff to provide ten thousand <a href="person.htm">person</a>s<br/>
with <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>ing for two years. In well-managed coal mines the labour of a<br/>
hundred miners furnishes each year enough fuel to warm ten thousand<br/>
families under an inclement sky. And <a href="we.htm">we</a> have <a href="late.htm">late</a>ly witnessed the<br/>
spectacle of wonderful cities springing up in a few months for<br/>
international exhibitions, without interrupting in the slightest degree<br/>
the regular <a href="work.htm">work</a> of the nations.<br/>
<br/>
And if in manufactures as in <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture, and as indeed through <a href="our.htm">our</a><br/>
whole social system, the labour, the discoveries, and the inventions of<br/>
<a href="our.htm">our</a> ancestors <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> chiefly the few, it is none the less certain that<br/>
mankind in general, aided by the <a href="creat.htm">creat</a>ures of steel and iron which it<br/>
already possesses, could already procure an existence of wealth and ease<br/>
for every one of its members.<br/>
<br/>
Truly, <a href="we.htm">we</a> are rich--far richer than <a href="we.htm">we</a> think; rich in what <a href="we.htm">we</a> already<br/>
possess, richer still in the possibilities of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion of <a href="our.htm">our</a> <a href="act.htm">act</a>ual<br/>
mechanical outfit; richest of all in what <a href="we.htm">we</a> might <a href="win.htm">win</a> from <a href="our.htm">our</a> soil,<br/>
from <a href="our.htm">our</a> manufactures, from <a href="our.htm">our</a> science, from <a href="our.htm">our</a> technical knowledge,<br/>
were they but applied to bringing about the well-being of all.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
II<br/>
<br/>
In <a href="our.htm">our</a> civilized societies <a href="we.htm">we</a> are rich. Why then are the many poor? Why<br/>
this painful drudgery for the masses? Why, even to the best <a href="paid.htm">paid</a><br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>man, this uncertainty for the morrow, in the midst of all the wealth<br/>
inherited from the <a href="past.htm">past</a>, and in spite of the powerful <a href="means.htm">means</a> of<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, which could ensure comfort to all, in <a href="return.htm">return</a> for a few hours<br/>
of daily toil?<br/>
<br/>
The Socialists have said it and repeated it unwearyingly. Daily they<br/>
reiterate it, demonstrating it by arguments taken from all the sciences.<br/>
It is because all that is necessary for <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion--the <a href="land.htm">land</a>, the mines,<br/>
the highways, machinery, <a href="food.htm">food</a>, <a href="shelter.htm">shelter</a>, education, knowledge--all have<br/>
been seized by the few in the course of that long story of robbery,<br/>
enforced migration and wars, of ignorance and oppression, which has been<br/>
the life of the human race before it had learned to subdue the forces of<br/>
Nature. It is because, taking advantage of alleged rights acquired in<br/>
the <a href="past.htm">past</a>, these few appropriate to-day two-thirds of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts of<br/>
human labour, and then squander them in the most stupid and shameful<br/>
way. It is because, having reduced the masses to a <a href="point.htm">point</a> at which they<br/>
have not the <a href="means.htm">means</a> of subsistence for a month, or even for a week in<br/>
advance, the few can allow the many to <a href="work.htm">work</a>, only on the condition of<br/>
themselves receiving the lion's <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e. It is because these few prevent<br/>
the remainder of men from <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing the <a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s they <a href="need.htm">need</a>, and force them<br/>
to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e, not the necessaries of life for all, but whatever offers the<br/>
greatest <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s to the monopolists. In this is the substance of all<br/>
Socialism.<br/>
<br/>
Take, indeed, a civilized country. The forests which once covered it<br/>
have been cleared, the marshes drained, the climate improved. It has<br/>
been made habitable. The soil, which bore formerly only a coarse<br/>
vegetation, is covered to-day with rich har<a href="vest.htm">vest</a>s. The rock-<a href="wall.htm">wall</a>s in the<br/>
valleys are laid out in terraces and covered with vines. The wild<br/>
<a href="plant.htm">plant</a>s, which yielded nought but acrid berries, or uneatable roots, have<br/>
been <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>formed by generations of culture into succulent vegetables or<br/>
trees covered with delicious fruits. Thousands of highways and railroads<br/>
furrow the earth, and pierce the mountains. The shriek of the engine is<br/>
heard in the wild gorges of the Alps, the Caucasus, and the Himalayas.<br/>
The rivers have been made navigable; the coasts, carefully surveyed, are<br/>
easy of access; artificial harbours, <a href="labor.htm">labor</a>iously dug out and <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ed<br/>
aga<a href="inst.htm">inst</a> the fury of the sea, afford <a href="shelter.htm">shelter</a> to the ships. Deep shafts<br/>
have been <a href="sun.htm">sun</a>k in the rocks; labyrinths of underground galleries have<br/>
been dug out where coal may be raised or minerals extracted. At the<br/>
<a href="cross.htm">cross</a>ings of the highways great cities have sprung up, and within their<br/>
borders all the treasures of industry, science, and art have been<br/>
accumu<a href="late.htm">late</a>d.<br/>
<br/>
Whole generations, that lived and died in misery, oppressed and<br/>
ill-treated by their masters, and worn out by toil, have handed on this<br/>
immense inheritance to <a href="our.htm">our</a> century.<br/>
<br/>
For thousands of years millions of men have laboured to clear the<br/>
forests, to drain the marshes, and to <a href="open.htm">open</a> up highways by <a href="land.htm">land</a> and<br/>
<a href="water.htm">water</a>. Every rood of soil <a href="we.htm">we</a> cultivate in Europe has been <a href="water.htm">water</a>ed by the<br/>
sweat of several races of men. Every acre has its story of enforced<br/>
labour, of intolerable toil, of the people's sufferings. Every mile of<br/>
railway, every yard of tunnel, has received its <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e of human blood.<br/>
<br/>
The shafts of the mine still bear on their rocky <a href="wall.htm">wall</a>s the marks made by<br/>
the pick of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>man who toiled to excavate them. The space between<br/>
each prop in the underground galleries might be marked as a miner's<br/>
grave; and who can tell what each of these graves has <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>, in tears, in<br/>
privations, in unspeakable wretchedness to the family who depended on<br/>
the scanty <a href="wage.htm">wage</a> of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er cut off in his prime by fire-damp,<br/>
rock-fall, or flood?<br/>
<br/>
The cities, bound together by railroads and <a href="water.htm">water</a>ways, are <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nisms<br/>
which have lived through centuries. Dig <a href="bene.htm">bene</a>ath them and you find, one<br/>
above another, the foundations of streets, of houses, of theatres, of<br/>
public buildings. Search into their history and you will see how the<br/>
civilization of the town, its industry, its special characteristics,<br/>
have slowly <a href="grow.htm">grow</a>n and ripened through the co-operation of generations of<br/>
its inhabitants before it could become what it is to-day. And even<br/>
to-day, the <a href="valu.htm">valu</a>e of each dwelling, <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>y, and warehouse, which has<br/>
been <a href="creat.htm">creat</a>ed by the accumu<a href="late.htm">late</a>d labour of the millions of <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers, now<br/>
dead and buried, is only maintained by the very presence and labour of<br/>
legions of the men who now inhabit that special corner of the globe.<br/>
Each of the atoms composing what <a href="we.htm">we</a> call the Wealth of Nations owes its<br/>
<a href="valu.htm">valu</a>e to the fact that it is a part of the great whole. What would a<br/>
London dockyard or a great Paris warehouse be if they were not situated<br/>
in these great centres of international <a href="commer.htm">commer</a>ce? What would become of<br/>
<a href="our.htm">our</a> mines, <a href="our.htm">our</a> <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies, <a href="our.htm">our</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a>shops, and <a href="our.htm">our</a> railways, without the<br/>
immense quantities of merchandise <a href="trans.htm">trans</a><a href="port.htm">port</a>ed every day by sea and <a href="land.htm">land</a>?<br/>
<br/>
Millions of human beings have laboured to <a href="creat.htm">creat</a>e this civilization on<br/>
which <a href="we.htm">we</a> pride <a href="our.htm">our</a>selves to-day. Other millions, scattered through the<br/>
globe, labour to maintain it. Without them no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> would be left in<br/>
fifty years but ruins.<br/>
<br/>
There is not even a thought, or an invention, which is not <a href="common.htm">common</a><br/>
<a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty, born of the <a href="past.htm">past</a> and the present. Thousands of inventors,<br/>
known and unknown, who have died in po<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>y, have co-operated in the<br/>
invention of each of these machines which embody the genius of man.<br/>
<br/>
Thousands of writers, of poets, of scholars, have laboured to increase<br/>
knowledge, to dissipate error, and to <a href="creat.htm">creat</a>e that atmosphere of<br/>
scientific thought, without which the marvels of <a href="our.htm">our</a> century could never<br/>
have appeared. And these thousands of philosophers, of poets, of<br/>
scholars, of inventors, have themselves been sup<a href="port.htm">port</a>ed by the labour of<br/>
<a href="past.htm">past</a> centuries. They have been upheld and nourished through life, <a href="bot.htm">bot</a>h<br/>
<a href="phys.htm">phys</a>ically and mentally, by legions of <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers and craftsmen of all<br/>
<a href="sort.htm">sort</a>s. They have drawn their motive force from the environment.<br/>
<br/>
The genius of a Séguin, a Mayer, a Grove, has certainly done more to<br/>
launch industry in <a href="new.htm">new</a> directions than all the <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ists in the world.<br/>
But men of genius are themselves the children of industry as well as of<br/>
science. Not until thousands of s<a href="team.htm">team</a>-engines had been <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing for years<br/>
before all eyes, constantly <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>forming heat into dynamic force, and<br/>
this force into sound, light, and electricity, could the insight of<br/>
genius proclaim the mechanical origin and the unity of the <a href="phys.htm">phys</a>ical<br/>
forces. And if <a href="we.htm">we</a>, children of the nineteenth century, have at last<br/>
grasped this idea, if <a href="we.htm">we</a> know now how to apply it, it is again because<br/>
daily experience has prepared the way. The thinkers of the eighteenth<br/>
century saw and declared it, but the idea remained undeveloped, because<br/>
the eighteenth century had not <a href="grow.htm">grow</a>n up like <a href="our.htm">our</a>s, side by side with the<br/>
s<a href="team.htm">team</a>-engine. Imagine the decades that might have <a href="pass.htm">pass</a>ed while <a href="we.htm">we</a><br/>
remained in ignorance of this <a href="law.htm">law</a>, which has revolutionized <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern<br/>
industry, had Watt not found at Soho <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>ed <a href="work.htm">work</a>men to embody his ideas<br/>
in <a href="meta.htm">meta</a>l, bringing all the parts of his engine to perfection, so that<br/>
s<a href="team.htm">team</a>, pent in a complete mechanism, and rendered more docile than a<br/>
horse, more manageable than <a href="water.htm">water</a>, became at last the very soul of<br/>
<a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern industry.<br/>
<br/>
Every machine has had the same history--a long record of sleepless<br/>
nights and of po<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>y, of disillusions and of joys, of partial<br/>
improvements discovered by several generations of <a href="name.htm">name</a>less <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers, who<br/>
have added to the original invention these little no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s, without<br/>
which the most fertile idea would remain fruitless. More than that:<br/>
every <a href="new.htm">new</a> invention is a synthesis, the resultant of innumerable<br/>
inventions which have preceded it in the vast field of mechanics and<br/>
industry.<br/>
<br/>
Science and industry, knowledge and application, discovery and practical<br/>
realization leading to <a href="new.htm">new</a> discoveries, cunning of brain and of hand,<br/>
toil of mind and muscle--all <a href="work.htm">work</a> together. Each discovery, each<br/>
advance, each increase in the sum of human riches, owes its being to<br/>
the <a href="phys.htm">phys</a>ical and mental travail of the <a href="past.htm">past</a> and the present.<br/>
<br/>
By what right then can any one whatever appropriate the least morsel of<br/>
this immense whole and say--This is mine, not yours?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
III<br/>
<br/>
It has come about, however, in the course of the ages traversed by the<br/>
human race, that all that enables man to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e and to increase his<br/>
power of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion has been seized by the few. Some <a href="time.htm">time</a>, perhaps, <a href="we.htm">we</a><br/>
will re<a href="late.htm">late</a> how this came to <a href="pass.htm">pass</a>. For the present let it suffice to<br/>
state the fact and analyze its consequences.<br/>
<br/>
To-day the soil, which <a href="act.htm">act</a>ually owes its <a href="valu.htm">valu</a>e to the <a href="need.htm">need</a>s of an<br/>
ever-increasing population, belongs to a minority who prevent the people<br/>
from cultivating it--or do not allow them to cultivate it according to<br/>
<a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern methods.<br/>
<br/>
The mines, though they represent the labour of several generations, and<br/>
derive their sole <a href="valu.htm">valu</a>e from the requirements of the industry of a<br/>
nation and the density of the population--the mines also belong to the<br/>
few; and these few restrict the <a href="output.htm">output</a> of coal, or prevent it entirely,<br/>
if they find more <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>able in<a href="vest.htm">vest</a>ments for their <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>. Machinery,<br/>
too, has become the exclusive <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty of the few, and even when a<br/>
machine incontestably represents the improvements added to the original<br/>
rough invention by three or four generations of <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers, it none the<br/>
less belongs to a few <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers. And if the descendants of the very<br/>
inventor who constructed the first machine for lace-making, a century<br/>
ago, were to present themselves to-day in a lace <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>y at Bâle or<br/>
Nottingham, and claim their rights, they would be told: "Hands off! this<br/>
machine is not yours," and they would be shot down if they attempted to<br/>
take possession of it.<br/>
<br/>
The railways, which would be <a href="use.htm">use</a>less as so much <a href="old.htm">old</a> iron without the<br/>
<a href="teem.htm">teem</a>ing population of Europe, its industry, its <a href="commer.htm">commer</a>ce, and its marts,<br/>
belong to a few <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e<a href="hold.htm">hold</a>ers, ignorant perhaps of the whereabouts of<br/>
the lines of rails which yield them revenues greater than those of<br/>
medieval kings. And if the children of those who perished by thousands<br/>
while excavating the railway cuttings and tunnels were to assemble one<br/>
day, <a href="crowd.htm">crowd</a>ing in their rags and hunger, to demand <a href="bread.htm">bread</a> from the<br/>
<a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e<a href="hold.htm">hold</a>ers, they would be met with bayonets and grapeshot, to disperse<br/>
them and safeguard "<a href="vest.htm">vest</a>ed <a href="interest.htm">interest</a>s."<br/>
<br/>
In <a href="virt.htm">virt</a>ue of this monstrous system, the son of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er, on entering<br/>
life, finds no field which he may till, no machine which he may tend, no<br/>
mine in which he may dig, without accepting to leave a great part of<br/>
what he will <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e to a master. He <a href="must.htm">must</a> <a href="sell.htm">sell</a> his labour for a scant<br/>
and uncertain <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>. His father and his grandfather have toiled to drain<br/>
this field, to build this mill, to perfect this machine. They gave to<br/>
the <a href="work.htm">work</a> the full measure of their strength, and what more could they<br/>
give? But their heir comes into the world poorer than the lowest savage.<br/>
If he obtains leave to till the fields, it is on condition of<br/>
surrendering a quarter of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e to his master, and another quarter<br/>
to the government and the middlemen. And this <a href="tax.htm">tax</a>, levied upon him by<br/>
the State, the <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ist, the lord of the manor, and the middleman, is<br/>
always increasing; it rarely leaves him the power to improve his system<br/>
of culture. If he turns to industry, he is allowed to <a href="work.htm">work</a>--though not<br/>
always even that--only on condition that he yield a half or two-thirds<br/>
of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t to him whom the <a href="land.htm">land</a> recognizes as the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of the<br/>
machine.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> cry shame on the feudal baron who forbade the peasant to turn a clod<br/>
of earth unless he surrendered to his lord a fourth of his crop. <a href="we.htm">We</a><br/>
called those the barbarous <a href="time.htm">time</a>s. But if the forms have <a href="chang.htm">chang</a>ed, the<br/>
relations have remained the same, and the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er is forced, under the<br/>
<a href="name.htm">name</a> of <a href="free.htm">free</a> contract, to accept feudal obligations. For, turn where he<br/>
will, he can find no better conditions. Every<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> has become private<br/>
<a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty, and he <a href="must.htm">must</a> accept, or die of hunger.<br/>
<br/>
The result of this state of <a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s is that all <a href="our.htm">our</a> <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion tends in a<br/>
wrong direction. Enterprise takes no thought for the <a href="need.htm">need</a>s of the<br/>
<a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ity. Its only aim is to increase the gains of the speculator.<br/>
Hence the constant fluctuations of <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e, the periodical industrial<br/>
crises, each of which throws scores of thousands of <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers on the<br/>
streets.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing people cannot <a href="purch.htm">purch</a>ase with their <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>s the wealth which<br/>
they have <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed, and industry seeks foreign markets among the monied<br/>
<a href="class.htm">class</a>es of other nations. In the East, in Africa, everywhere, in Egypt,<br/>
Tonkin or the Congo, the European is thus bound to promote the <a href="grow.htm">grow</a>th of<br/>
serfdom. And so he does. But soon he finds that everywhere there are<br/>
similar competitors. All the nations evolve on the same lines, and wars,<br/>
perpetual wars, break out for the right of precedence in the market.<br/>
Wars for the possession of the East, wars for the empire of the sea,<br/>
wars to impose duties on im<a href="port.htm">port</a>s and to dictate conditions to<br/>
neighbouring states; wars aga<a href="inst.htm">inst</a> those "blacks" who revolt! The roar of<br/>
the cannon never ceases in the world, whole races are massacred, the<br/>
states of Europe spend a third of their budgets in armaments; and <a href="we.htm">we</a><br/>
know how heavily these <a href="tax.htm">tax</a>es fall on the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
Education still remains the privilege of a small minority, for it is<br/>
idle to talk of education when the <a href="work.htm">work</a>man's child is forced, at the age<br/>
of thirteen, to go down into the mine or to help his father on the <a href="farm.htm">farm</a>.<br/>
It is idle to talk of studying to the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er, who comes home in the<br/>
evening wearied by excessive toil, and its brutalizing atmosphere.<br/>
Society is thus bound to remain divided into two hostile camps, and in<br/>
such conditions <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom is a vain <a href="word.htm">word</a>. The Radical begins by demanding<br/>
a greater extension of political rights, but he soon sees that the<br/>
breath of liberty leads to the uplifting of the proletariat, and then he<br/>
turns round, <a href="chang.htm">chang</a>es his opinions, and re<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>s to repressive legislation<br/>
and government by the s<a href="word.htm">word</a>.<br/>
<br/>
A vast array of courts, judges, executioners, policemen, and gaolers is<br/>
<a href="need.htm">need</a>ed to up<a href="hold.htm">hold</a> these privileges; and this array gives rise in its turn<br/>
to a whole system of espionage, of false witness, of spies, of threats<br/>
and corruption.<br/>
<br/>
The system under which <a href="we.htm">we</a> live checks in its turn the <a href="grow.htm">grow</a>th of the<br/>
social sen<a href="time.htm">time</a>nt. <a href="we.htm">We</a> all know that without uprightness, without<br/>
self-respect, without sympathy and mutual aid, human kind <a href="must.htm">must</a> perish,<br/>
as perish the few races of <a href="animal.htm">animal</a>s living by rapine, or the<br/>
slave-keeping ants. But such ideas are not to the taste of the ruling<br/>
<a href="class.htm">class</a>es, and they have e<a href="labor.htm">labor</a>ated a whole system of pseudo-science to<br/>
teach the contrary.<br/>
<br/>
Fine sermons have been preached on the <a href="text.htm">text</a> that those who have should<br/>
<a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e with those who have not, but he who would <a href="carry.htm">carry</a> out this principle<br/>
would be speedily <a href="info.htm">info</a>rmed that these beautiful sen<a href="time.htm">time</a>nts are all very<br/>
well in poetry, but not in practice. "To lie is to degrade and besmirch<br/>
oneself," <a href="we.htm">we</a> say, and yet all civilized life becomes one huge lie. <a href="we.htm">We</a><br/>
ac<a href="cust.htm">cust</a>om <a href="our.htm">our</a>selves and <a href="our.htm">our</a> children to hypocrisy, to the practice of a<br/>
double-faced morality. And since the brain is ill at ease among lies, <a href="we.htm">we</a><br/>
cheat <a href="our.htm">our</a>selves with sophistry. Hypocrisy and sophistry become the<br/>
s<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>d nature of the civilized man.<br/>
<br/>
But a society cannot live thus; it <a href="must.htm">must</a> <a href="return.htm">return</a> to truth, or cease to<br/>
exist.<br/>
<br/>
Thus the consequences which spring from the original <a href="act.htm">act</a> of monopoly<br/>
spread through the whole of social life. Under pain of death, human<br/>
societies are forced to <a href="return.htm">return</a> to first principles: the <a href="means.htm">means</a> of<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion being the collective <a href="work.htm">work</a> of humanity, the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t should be<br/>
the collective <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty of the race. Individual appropriation is neither<br/>
just nor <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>iceable. All belongs to all. All <a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s are for all men,<br/>
since all men have <a href="need.htm">need</a> of them, since all men have <a href="work.htm">work</a>ed in the<br/>
measure of their strength to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e them, and since it is not possible<br/>
to e<a href="valu.htm">valu</a>ate every one's part in the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion of the world's wealth.<br/>
<br/>
All <a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s for all. Here is an immense stock of tools and implements;<br/>
here are all those iron slaves which <a href="we.htm">we</a> call machines, which saw and<br/>
<a href="plan.htm">plan</a>e, spin and weave for <a href="us.htm">us</a>, unmaking and remaking, <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing up raw<br/>
<a href="matt.htm">matt</a>er to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e the marvels of <a href="our.htm">our</a> <a href="time.htm">time</a>. But nobody has the right to<br/>
seize a single one of these machines and say: "This is mine; if you<br/>
<a href="want.htm">want</a> to <a href="use.htm">use</a> it you <a href="must.htm">must</a> <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> me a <a href="tax.htm">tax</a> on each of your <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts," any more<br/>
than the feudal lord of medieval <a href="time.htm">time</a>s had the right to say to the<br/>
peasant: "This hill, this meadow belong to me, and you <a href="must.htm">must</a> <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> me a <a href="tax.htm">tax</a><br/>
on every sheaf of corn you reap, on every brick you build."<br/>
<br/>
All is for all! If the man and the woman bear their fair <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e of <a href="work.htm">work</a>,<br/>
they have a right to their fair <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e of all that is <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed by all,<br/>
and that <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e is enough to <a href="secur.htm">secur</a>e them well-being. No more of such<br/>
vague formulas as "The right to <a href="work.htm">work</a>," or "To each the whole result of<br/>
his labour." What <a href="we.htm">we</a> proclaim is THE RIGHT TO WELL-BEING: WELL-BEING FOR<br/>
ALL!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
CHAPTER II<br/>
<br/>
WELL-BEING FOR ALL<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I<br/>
<br/>
Well-being for all is not a dream. It is possible, realizable, owing to<br/>
all that <a href="our.htm">our</a> ancestors have done to increase <a href="our.htm">our</a> powers of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> know, indeed, that the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ers, although they constitute hardly<br/>
one-third of the inhabitants of civilized countries, even now <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e<br/>
such quantities of <a href="good.htm">good</a>s that a certain degree of comfort could be<br/>
brought to every hearth. <a href="we.htm">We</a> know further that if all those who squander<br/>
to-day the fruits of others' toil were forced to <a href="employ.htm">employ</a> their leisure in<br/>
<a href="use.htm">use</a>ful <a href="work.htm">work</a>, <a href="our.htm">our</a> wealth would increase in pro<a href="port.htm">port</a>ion to the number of<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ers, and more. Finally, <a href="we.htm">we</a> know that contrary to the theory<br/>
enunciated by Malthus--that Oracle of middle-<a href="class.htm">class</a> <a href="econ.htm">Econ</a>omics--the<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive powers of the human race increase at a much more rapid ratio<br/>
than its powers of re<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion. The more thickly men are <a href="crowd.htm">crowd</a>ed on the<br/>
soil, the more rapid is the <a href="grow.htm">grow</a>th of their wealth-<a href="creat.htm">creat</a>ing power.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, although the population of Eng<a href="land.htm">land</a> has only increased from 1844 to<br/>
1890 by 62 per cent., its <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion has <a href="grow.htm">grow</a>n, even at the lowest<br/>
estimate, at double that rate--to wit, by 130 per cent. In France, where<br/>
the population has <a href="grow.htm">grow</a>n more slowly, the increase in <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion is<br/>
ne<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>heless very rapid. Notwithstanding the crises through which<br/>
<a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture is frequently <a href="pass.htm">pass</a>ing, notwithstanding State interference,<br/>
the blood-<a href="tax.htm">tax</a> <small>(conscription)</small>, and speculative <a href="commer.htm">commer</a>ce and finance, the<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion of wheat in France has increased four-fold, and industrial<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion more than tenfold, in the course of the last eighty years. In<br/>
the United States this progress is still more striking. In spite of<br/>
immigration, or rather precisely because of the influx of <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a><br/>
European labour, the United States have multiplied their wealth tenfold.<br/>
<br/>
However, these figures give but a very faint idea of what <a href="our.htm">our</a> wealth<br/>
might become under better conditions. For alongside of the rapid<br/>
<a href="dev.htm">dev</a>elopment of <a href="our.htm">our</a> wealth-<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing powers <a href="we.htm">we</a> have an overwhelming<br/>
increase in the ranks of the idlers and middlemen. <a href="inst.htm">Inst</a>ead of <a href="capital.htm">capital</a><br/>
gradually concentrating itself in a few hands, so that it would only be<br/>
necessary for the <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ity to dispossess a few millionaires and enter<br/>
upon its <a href="law.htm">law</a>ful heritage--<a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ead of this Socialist forecast proving<br/>
true, the exact reverse is coming to <a href="pass.htm">pass</a>: the swarm of parasites is<br/>
ever increasing.<br/>
<br/>
In France there are not ten <a href="act.htm">act</a>ual <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ers to every thirty<br/>
inhabitants. The whole <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>cultural wealth of the country is the <a href="work.htm">work</a> of<br/>
less than seven millions of men, and in the two great industries, mining<br/>
and the <a href="text.htm">text</a>ile <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>es, you will find that the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers number less than<br/>
two and one-half millions. But the exploiters of labour, how many are<br/>
they? In the United Kingdom a little over one million <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers--men,<br/>
women, and children, are <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ed in all the <a href="text.htm">text</a>ile <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>es; less than<br/>
nine hundred thousand <a href="work.htm">work</a> the mines; much less than two million till<br/>
the ground, and it appeared from the last industrial census that only a<br/>
little over four million men, women and children were <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ed in all<br/>
the industries.<small>[1]</small> So that the statisticians have to exaggerate all the<br/>
figures in order to establish a maximum of eight million <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ers to<br/>
forty-five million inhabitants. Strictly speaking the <a href="creat.htm">creat</a>ors of the<br/>
<a href="good.htm">good</a>s ex<a href="port.htm">port</a>ed from Britain to all the ends of the earth comprise only<br/>
from six to seven million <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers. And what is the number of the<br/>
<a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e<a href="hold.htm">hold</a>ers and middlemen who levy the first fruits of labour from far<br/>
and near, and heap up unearned gains by thrusting themselves between<br/>
the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>er and the <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>er?<br/>
<br/>
Nor is this all. The <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of <a href="capital.htm">capital</a> constantly reduce the <a href="output.htm">output</a> by<br/>
restraining <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion. <a href="we.htm">We</a> <a href="need.htm">need</a> not speak of the cartloads of oysters<br/>
thrown into the sea to prevent a dainty, hitherto re<a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ed for the rich,<br/>
from becoming a <a href="food.htm">food</a> for the people. <a href="we.htm">We</a> <a href="need.htm">need</a> not speak of the thousand<br/>
and one luxuries--stuffs, <a href="food.htm">food</a>s, etc., etc.--treated after the same<br/>
fashion as the oysters. It is enough to remember the way in which the<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion of the most necessary <a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s is limited. Legions of miners<br/>
are ready and willing to dig out coal every day, and send it to those<br/>
who are shivering with cold; but too often a third, or even one-half, of<br/>
their number are forbidden to <a href="work.htm">work</a> more than three days a week, because,<br/>
forsooth, the <a href="price.htm">price</a> of coal <a href="must.htm">must</a> be kept up! Thousands of weavers are<br/>
forbidden to <a href="work.htm">work</a> the looms, although their wives and children go in<br/>
rags, and although three-quarters of the population of Europe have no<br/>
<a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>ing <a href="worth.htm">worth</a>y the <a href="name.htm">name</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Hundreds of blast-furnaces, thousands of <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies periodically stand<br/>
idle, others only <a href="work.htm">work</a> half-<a href="time.htm">time</a>--and in every civilized nation there is<br/>
a permanent population of about two million individuals who ask only for<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>, but to whom <a href="work.htm">work</a> is denied.<br/>
<br/>
How gladly would these millions of men set to <a href="work.htm">work</a> to reclaim waste<br/>
<a href="land.htm">land</a>s, or to <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>form ill-cultivated <a href="land.htm">land</a> into fertile fields, rich in<br/>
har<a href="vest.htm">vest</a>s! A year of well-directed toil would suffice to multiply<br/>
fivefold the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e of those millions of acres in this country which<br/>
lie idle now as "permanent <a href="past.htm">past</a>ure," or of those dry <a href="land.htm">land</a>s in the south<br/>
of France which now yield only about eight bushels of wheat per acre.<br/>
But men, who would be happy to become hardy pioneers in so many branches<br/>
of wealth-<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing <a href="act.htm">act</a>ivity, <a href="must.htm">must</a> remain idle because the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of the<br/>
soil, the mines and the <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies prefer to in<a href="vest.htm">vest</a> their <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>--taken<br/>
in the first place from the <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ity--in Turkish or Egyptian bonds, or<br/>
in Patagonian <a href="gold.htm">gold</a> mines, and so <a href="make.htm">make</a> Egyptian fellahs, Italian<br/>
emigrants, and Chinese coolies their <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>-slaves.<br/>
<br/>
This is the direct and deliberate limitation of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion; but there<br/>
is also a limitation indirect and not of set purpose, which consists in<br/>
spending human toil on <a href="object.htm">object</a>s ab<a href="solu.htm">solu</a>tely <a href="use.htm">use</a>less, or destined only to<br/>
satisfy the dull vanity of the rich.<br/>
<br/>
It is impossible to reckon in figures the extent to which wealth is<br/>
restricted indirectly, the extent to which energy is squandered, while<br/>
it might have <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ed to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e, and above all to prepare the machinery<br/>
necessary to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion. It is enough to cite the immense sums spent by<br/>
Europe in armaments, for the sole purpose of acquiring <a href="control.htm">control</a> of<br/>
markets, and so forcing her <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="good.htm">good</a>s on neighbouring territories, and<br/>
making exploitation easier at home; the millions <a href="paid.htm">paid</a> every year to<br/>
officials of all <a href="sort.htm">sort</a>s, whose function it is to maintain the "rights" of<br/>
minorities--the right, that is, of a few rich men--to manipu<a href="late.htm">late</a> the<br/>
<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic <a href="act.htm">act</a>ivities of the nation; the millions spent on judges,<br/>
prisons, policemen, and all the paraphernalia of so-called<br/>
justice--spent to no purpose, because <a href="we.htm">we</a> know that every alleviation,<br/>
however slight, of the wretchedness of <a href="our.htm">our</a> great cities is always<br/>
followed by a considerable diminution of crime; lastly, the millions<br/>
spent on propagating pernicious doctrines by <a href="means.htm">means</a> of the press, and<br/>
<a href="new.htm">new</a>s "cooked" in the <a href="interest.htm">interest</a> of this or that party, of this politician<br/>
or of that <a href="group.htm">group</a> of speculators.<br/>
<br/>
But over and above this <a href="we.htm">we</a> <a href="must.htm">must</a> take into account all the labour that<br/>
goes to sheer waste,--here, in keeping up the stables, the kennels, and<br/>
the retinue of the rich; there, in pandering to the ca<a href="price.htm">price</a>s of society<br/>
and the depraved tastes of the fashionable mob; there again, in forcing<br/>
the <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>er to <a href="buy.htm">buy</a> what he does not <a href="need.htm">need</a>, or foisting an inferior<br/>
article upon him by <a href="means.htm">means</a> of puffery, and in <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing on the other hand<br/>
wares which are ab<a href="solu.htm">solu</a>tely injurious, but <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>able to the<br/>
manufacturer. What is squandered in this manner would be enough to<br/>
double the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion of <a href="use.htm">use</a>ful <a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s, or so to plenish <a href="our.htm">our</a> mills and<br/>
<a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies with machinery that they would soon flood the shops with all<br/>
that is now lacking to two-thirds of the nation. Under <a href="our.htm">our</a> present<br/>
system a full quarter of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ers in every nation are forced to be<br/>
idle for three or four months in the year, and the labour of another<br/>
quarter, if not of the half, has no better results than the amusement of<br/>
the rich or the exploitation of the public.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, if <a href="we.htm">we</a> consider on the one hand the rapidity with which civilized<br/>
nations augment their powers of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, and on the other hand the<br/>
limits set to that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, be it directly or indirectly, by existing<br/>
conditions, <a href="we.htm">we</a> cannot but conclude that an <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic system a trifle more<br/>
reasonable would permit them to heap up in a few years so many <a href="use.htm">use</a>ful<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts that they would be constrained to say--"Enough! <a href="we.htm">We</a> have enough<br/>
coal and <a href="bread.htm">bread</a> and raiment! Let <a href="us.htm">us</a> rest and consider how best to <a href="use.htm">use</a> <a href="our.htm">our</a><br/>
powers, how best to <a href="employ.htm">employ</a> <a href="our.htm">our</a> leisure."<br/>
<br/>
No, plenty for all is not a dream--though it was a dream indeed in those<br/>
days when man, for all his pains, could hardly <a href="win.htm">win</a> a few bushels of<br/>
wheat from an acre of <a href="land.htm">land</a>, and had to fashion by hand all the<br/>
implements he <a href="use.htm">use</a>d in <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture and industry. Now it is no longer a<br/>
dream, because man has invented a motor which, with a little iron and a<br/>
few sacks of coal, gives him the mastery of a <a href="creat.htm">creat</a>ure strong and docile<br/>
as a horse, and capable of setting the most complicated machinery in<br/>
motion.<br/>
<br/>
But, if plenty for all is to become a reality, this immense<br/>
<a href="capital.htm">capital</a>--cities, houses, <a href="past.htm">past</a>ures, arable <a href="land.htm">land</a>s, <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies, highways,<br/>
education--<a href="must.htm">must</a> cease to be regarded as private <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty, for the<br/>
monopolist to dispose of at his pleasure.<br/>
<br/>
This rich endowment, painfully won, builded, fashioned, or invented by<br/>
<a href="our.htm">our</a> ancestors, <a href="must.htm">must</a> become <a href="common.htm">common</a> <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty, so that the collective<br/>
<a href="interest.htm">interest</a>s of men may gain from it the greatest <a href="good.htm">good</a> for all.<br/>
<br/>
There <a href="must.htm">must</a> be EXPROPRIATION. The well-being of all--the end;<br/>
expropriation--the <a href="means.htm">means</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
II<br/>
<br/>
Expropriation, such then is the problem which History has put before the<br/>
men of the twentieth century: the <a href="return.htm">return</a> to <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ism in all that<br/>
ministers to the well-being of man.<br/>
<br/>
But this problem cannot be <a href="solv.htm">solv</a>ed by <a href="means.htm">means</a> of legislation. No one<br/>
imagines that. The poor, as well as the rich, understand that neither<br/>
the existing Governments, nor any which might arise out of possible<br/>
political <a href="chang.htm">chang</a>es, would be capable of finding such a <a href="solu.htm">solu</a>tion. They<br/>
feel the necessity of a social revolution; and <a href="bot.htm">bot</a>h rich and poor<br/>
recognize that this revolution is imminent, that it may break out in a<br/>
few years.<br/>
<br/>
A great <a href="chang.htm">chang</a>e in thought has taken place during the last half of the<br/>
nineteenth century; but suppressed, as it was, by the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>tied<br/>
<a href="class.htm">class</a>es, and denied its natural <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>elopment, this <a href="new.htm">new</a> spirit <a href="must.htm">must</a> now<br/>
break its bonds by violence and realize itself in a revolution.<br/>
<br/>
Whence will the revolution come? how will it announce its coming? No one<br/>
can answer these questions. The <a href="future.htm">future</a> is hidden. But those who watch<br/>
and think do not misinterpret the signs: <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers and exploiters,<br/>
Revolutionists and Con<a href="serv.htm">serv</a>atives, thinkers and men of <a href="act.htm">act</a>ion, all feel<br/>
that a revolution is at <a href="our.htm">our</a> doors.<br/>
<br/>
Well, then,--What are <a href="we.htm">we</a> going to do when the thunderbolt has fallen?<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> have all been bent on studying the dramatic side of revolutions so<br/>
much, and the practical <a href="work.htm">work</a> of revolutions so little, that <a href="we.htm">we</a> are apt<br/>
to see only the stage effects, so to speak, of these great movements;<br/>
the fight of the first days; the barricades. But this fight, this first<br/>
skirmish, is soon ended, and it only after the breakdown of the <a href="old.htm">old</a><br/>
system that the real <a href="work.htm">work</a> of revolution can be said to begin.<br/>
<br/>
Effete and powerless, attacked on all sides, the <a href="old.htm">old</a> rulers are soon<br/>
swept away by the breath of <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>rection. In a few days the middle-<a href="class.htm">class</a><br/>
monarchy of 1848 was no more, and while Louis Philippe was making <a href="good.htm">good</a><br/>
his escape in a cab, Paris had already forgotten her "citizen king." The<br/>
government of Thiers disappeared, on the 18th of March, 1871, in a few<br/>
hours, leaving Paris mistress of her destinies. Yet 1848 and 1871 were<br/>
only <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>rections. Before a popular revolution the masters of "the <a href="old.htm">old</a><br/>
order" disappear with a surprising rapidity. Its up<a href="hold.htm">hold</a>ers fly the<br/>
country, to plot in safety elsewhere and to <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>ise measures for their<br/>
<a href="return.htm">return</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The former Government having disappeared, the army, hesitating before<br/>
the tide of popular opinion, no longer obeys its commanders, who have<br/>
also prudently decamped. The troops stand by without interfering, or<br/>
<a href="join.htm">join</a> the rebels. The police, standing at ease, are uncertain whether to<br/>
belabour the <a href="crowd.htm">crowd</a>, or to cry: "Long live the <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>e!" while some<br/>
retire to their quarters to "await the pleasure of the <a href="new.htm">new</a> Government."<br/>
Wealthy citizens <a href="pack.htm">pack</a> their trunks and betake themselves to places of<br/>
safety. The people remain. This is how a revolution is ushered in.<br/>
<br/>
In several large towns the <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>e is proclaimed. In the streets wander<br/>
scores of thousands of men, and in the evening they <a href="crowd.htm">crowd</a> into<br/>
improvised clubs, asking: "What shall <a href="we.htm">we</a> do?" and ardently discuss<br/>
public affairs. All take an <a href="interest.htm">interest</a> in them; those who yesterday were<br/>
quite indiffe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> are perhaps the most zealous. Everywhere there is<br/>
plenty of <a href="good.htm">good</a>-will and a keen desire to <a href="make.htm">make</a> victory certain. It is a<br/>
<a href="time.htm">time</a> when <a href="act.htm">act</a>s of supreme <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>otion are occurring. The masses of the<br/>
people are full of the desire of going forward.<br/>
<br/>
All this is splendid, sublime; but still, it is not a revolution. Nay,<br/>
it is only now that the <a href="work.htm">work</a> of the revolutionist begins.<br/>
<br/>
Doubtless there will be <a href="act.htm">act</a>s of vengeance. The Watrins and the Thomases<br/>
will <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> the penalty of their unpopularity; but these are mere incidents<br/>
of the struggle--not the revolution.<br/>
<br/>
Socialist politicians, radicals, neglected geniuses of journalism, stump<br/>
orators--<a href="bot.htm">bot</a>h middle-<a href="class.htm">class</a> people and <a href="work.htm">work</a>men--will hurry to the Town<br/>
Hall, to the Government offices, to take possession of the vacant seats.<br/>
Some will decorate themselves with <a href="gold.htm">gold</a> and silver lace to their hearts'<br/>
content, admire themselves in ministerial mirrors, and study to give<br/>
orders with an air of im<a href="port.htm">port</a>ance appropriate to their <a href="new.htm">new</a> position. How<br/>
could they impress their comrades of the office or the <a href="work.htm">work</a>shop without<br/>
having a red sash, an embroidered cap, and magisterial gestures! Others<br/>
will bury themselves in official papers, trying, with the best of<br/>
wills, to <a href="make.htm">make</a> head or tail of them. They will indite <a href="law.htm">law</a>s and issue<br/>
high-flown <a href="word.htm">word</a>ed decrees that nobody will take the trouble to <a href="carry.htm">carry</a><br/>
out--because revolution has come.<br/>
<br/>
To give themselves an authority which they have not they will seek the<br/>
sanction of <a href="old.htm">old</a> forms of Government. They will take the <a href="name.htm">name</a>s of<br/>
"Provisional Government," "<a href="commit.htm">Commit</a>tee of Public Safety," "Mayor,"<br/>
"Governor of the Town Hall," "Commissioner of Public Safety," and what<br/>
not. Elected or acclaimed, they will assemble in Boards or in <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>al<br/>
Councils, where men of ten or twenty diffe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> schools will come<br/>
together, representing--not as many "private chapels," as it is often<br/>
said, but as many diffe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> conceptions regarding the scope, the<br/>
bearing, and the goal of the revolution. Possibilists, Collectivists,<br/>
Radicals, Jacobins, Blanquists, will be thrust together, and waste <a href="time.htm">time</a><br/>
in <a href="word.htm">word</a>y warfare. Honest men will be huddled together with the ambitious<br/>
ones, whose only dream is power and who spurn the <a href="crowd.htm">crowd</a> whence they are<br/>
sprung. All coming together with diametrically opposed views,<br/>
all--forced to enter into ephemeral alliances, in order to <a href="creat.htm">creat</a>e<br/>
majorities that can but last a day. Wrangling, calling each other<br/>
reactionaries, authoritarians, and rascals, incapable of coming to an<br/>
understanding on any serious measure, dragged into discussions about<br/>
trifles, <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> better than bombastic proclamations; all<br/>
giving themselves an awful im<a href="port.htm">port</a>ance while the real strength of the<br/>
movement is in the streets.<br/>
<br/>
All this may please those who like the stage, but it is not revolution.<br/>
No<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> has been accomplished as yet.<br/>
<br/>
And meanwhile the people suffer. The <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies are idle, the <a href="work.htm">work</a>shops<br/>
closed; <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e is at a standstill. The <a href="work.htm">work</a>er does not even earn the<br/>
meagre <a href="wage.htm">wage</a> which was his before. <a href="food.htm">Food</a> goes up in <a href="price.htm">price</a>. With that<br/>
heroic <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>otion which has always characterized them, and which in great<br/>
crises reaches the sublime, the people will wait patiently. "<a href="we.htm">We</a> place<br/>
these three months of <a href="want.htm">want</a> at the <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ice of the Republic," they said in<br/>
1848, while "their representatives" and the gentlemen of the <a href="new.htm">new</a><br/>
Government, down to the meanest Jack-in-office received their salary<br/>
regularly.<br/>
<br/>
The people suffer. With the childlike faith, with the <a href="good.htm">good</a> humour of the<br/>
masses who believe in their leaders, they think that "yonder," in the<br/>
House, in the Town Hall, in the <a href="commit.htm">Commit</a>tee of Public Safety, their<br/>
welfare is being considered. But "yonder" they are discussing every<a href="thing.htm">thing</a><br/>
under the <a href="sun.htm">sun</a> except the welfare of the people. In 1793, while famine<br/>
ravaged France and crippled the Revolution; whilst the people were<br/>
reduced to the depths of misery, although the Champs Elysées were lined<br/>
with luxurious carriages where women displayed their jewels and<br/>
splendour, Robespierre was urging the Jacobins to discuss his treatise<br/>
on the English Constitution. While the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er was suffering in 1848 from<br/>
the general stoppage of <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e, the Provisional Government and the<br/>
National Assembly were wrangling over military pensions and prison<br/>
labour, without troubling how the people managed to live during the<br/>
terrible crisis. And could one cast a reproach at the Paris <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>e,<br/>
which was born <a href="bene.htm">bene</a>ath the Prussian cannon, and lasted only seventy<br/>
days, it would be for this same error--this failure to understand that<br/>
the Revolution could not triumph unless those who fought on its side<br/>
were fed: that on fifteen pence a day a man cannot fight on the ramparts<br/>
and at the same <a href="time.htm">time</a> sup<a href="port.htm">port</a> a family.<br/>
<br/>
The people will suffer and say: "How is a way out of these difficulties<br/>
to be found?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
III<br/>
<br/>
It seems to <a href="us.htm">us</a> that there is only one answer to this question: <a href="we.htm">We</a> <a href="must.htm">must</a><br/>
recognize, and loudly proclaim, that every one, whatever his grade in<br/>
the <a href="old.htm">old</a> society, whether strong or weak, capable or incapable, has,<br/>
before every<a href="thing.htm">thing</a>, THE RIGHT TO LIVE, and that society is bound to <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e<br/>
amongst all, without exception, the <a href="means.htm">means</a> of existence it has at its<br/>
disposal. <a href="we.htm">We</a> <a href="must.htm">must</a> acknowledge this, and proclaim it aloud, and <a href="act.htm">act</a> up to<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Affairs <a href="must.htm">must</a> be managed in such a way that from the first day of the<br/>
revolution the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er shall know that a <a href="new.htm">new</a> era is <a href="open.htm">open</a>ing before him;<br/>
that henceforward none <a href="need.htm">need</a> crouch under the bridges, while palaces are<br/>
hard by, none <a href="need.htm">need</a> fast in the midst of plenty, none <a href="need.htm">need</a> perish with<br/>
cold near shops full of furs; that all is for all, in practice as well<br/>
as in theory, and that at last, for the first <a href="time.htm">time</a> in history, a<br/>
revolution has been accomplished which considers the <a href="need.htm">NEED</a>S of the people<br/>
before schooling them in their DUTIES.<br/>
<br/>
This cannot be brought about by <a href="act.htm">Act</a>s of Parliament, but only by taking<br/>
im<a href="media.htm">media</a>te and effective possession of all that is necessary to ensure<br/>
the well-being of all; this is the only really scientific way of going<br/>
to <a href="work.htm">work</a>, the only way which can be understood and desired by the mass of<br/>
the people. <a href="we.htm">We</a> <a href="must.htm">must</a> take possession, in the <a href="name.htm">name</a> of the people, of the<br/>
granaries, the shops full of <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>ing and the dwelling houses. No<a href="thing.htm">thing</a><br/>
<a href="must.htm">must</a> be wasted. <a href="we.htm">We</a> <a href="must.htm">must</a> <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nize without delay a way to feed the hungry,<br/>
to satisfy all <a href="want.htm">want</a>s, to meet all <a href="need.htm">need</a>s, to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e not for the special<br/>
<a href="bene.htm">bene</a>fit of this one or that one, but so as to ensure to society as a<br/>
whole its life and further <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>elopment.<br/>
<br/>
Enough of ambiguous <a href="word.htm">word</a>s like "the right to <a href="work.htm">work</a>," with which the<br/>
people were misled in 1848, and which are still re<a href="sort.htm">sort</a>ed to with the<br/>
hope of misleading them. Let <a href="us.htm">us</a> have the courage to recognise that<br/>
_Well-being for all_, henceforward possible, <a href="must.htm">must</a> be realized.<br/>
<br/>
When the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers claimed the right to <a href="work.htm">work</a> in 1848, national and<br/>
municipal <a href="work.htm">work</a>shops were <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nized, and <a href="work.htm">work</a>men were sent to drudge<br/>
there at the rate of 1s. 8d. a day! When they asked the "<a href="orga.htm">Orga</a>nization of<br/>
Labour," the reply was: "Patience, friends, the Government will see to<br/>
it; mean<a href="time.htm">time</a> here is your 1s. 8d. Rest now, brave toiler, after your<br/>
life-long struggle for <a href="food.htm">food</a>!" And in the mean<a href="time.htm">time</a> the cannons were<br/>
overhauled, the re<a href="serv.htm">serv</a>es called out, and the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers themselves<br/>
dis<a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nized by the many methods well known to the middle <a href="class.htm">class</a>es, till<br/>
one fine day, in June, 1848, four months after the o<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>hrow of the<br/>
previous Government, they were told to go and colonize Africa, or be<br/>
shot down.<br/>
<br/>
Very diffe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> will be the result if the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers claim the RIGHT TO<br/>
WELL-BEING! In claiming that right they claim the right to take<br/>
possession of the wealth of the <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ity--to take houses to dwell in<br/>
according to the <a href="need.htm">need</a>s of each family; to socialize the stores of <a href="food.htm">food</a><br/>
and learn the meaning of plenty, after having known famine too well.<br/>
They proclaim their right to all social wealth--fruit of the labour of<br/>
<a href="past.htm">past</a> and present generations--and learn by its <a href="means.htm">means</a> to enjoy those<br/>
higher pleasures of art and science which have too long been monopolized<br/>
by the rich.<br/>
<br/>
And while asserting their right to live in comfort, they assert, what is<br/>
still more im<a href="port.htm">port</a>ant, their right to decide for themselves what this<br/>
comfort shall be, what <a href="must.htm">must</a> be <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed to ensure it, and what discarded<br/>
as no longer of <a href="valu.htm">valu</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
The "right to well-being" <a href="means.htm">means</a> the possibility of living like human<br/>
beings, and of bringing up children to be members of a society better<br/>
than <a href="our.htm">our</a>s, whilst the "right to <a href="work.htm">work</a>" only <a href="means.htm">means</a> the right to be always<br/>
a <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>-slave, a drudge, ruled over and exploited by the middle <a href="class.htm">class</a> of<br/>
the <a href="future.htm">future</a>. The right to well-being is the Social Revolution, the right<br/>
to <a href="work.htm">work</a> <a href="means.htm">means</a> no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> but the Treadmill of <a href="commer.htm">Commer</a>cialism. It is high<br/>
<a href="time.htm">time</a> for the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er to assert his right to the <a href="common.htm">common</a> inheritance, and<br/>
to enter into possession of it.<br/>

CHAPTER III<br/>
<br/>
ANARCHIST <a href="commun.htm">COMMUN</a>ISM<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I<br/>
<br/>
Every society, on abolishing private <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty will be forced, <a href="we.htm">we</a><br/>
maintain, to <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nize itself on the lines of <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>istic Anarchy.<br/>
Anarchy leads to <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ism, and <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ism to Anarchy, <a href="bot.htm">bot</a>h alike being<br/>
expressions of the predominant tendency in <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern societies, the pursuit<br/>
of equality.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="time.htm">Time</a> was when a peasant family could consider the corn it sowed and<br/>
reaped, or the woolen garments woven in the cottage, as the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts of<br/>
its <a href="own.htm">own</a> soil. But even then this way of looking at <a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s was not quite<br/>
correct. There were the roads and the bridges made in <a href="common.htm">common</a>, the swamps<br/>
drained by <a href="common.htm">common</a> toil, the <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>al <a href="past.htm">past</a>ures enclosed by hedges which<br/>
were kept in repair by each and all. If the looms for weaving or the<br/>
dyes for colouring fabrics were improved by somebody, all <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>ed; and<br/>
even in those days a peasant family could not live alone, but was<br/>
dependent in a thousand ways on the village or the <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
But nowadays, in the present state of industry, when every<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> is<br/>
interdependent, when each branch of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion is knit up with all the<br/>
rest, the attempt to claim an Individualist origin for the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts of<br/>
industry is ab<a href="solu.htm">solu</a>tely untenable. The astonishing perfection attained by<br/>
the <a href="text.htm">text</a>ile or mining industries in civilized countries is due to the<br/>
simultaneous <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>elopment of a thousand other industries, great and<br/>
small, to the extension of the railroad system, to inter-oceanic<br/>
navigation, to the manual <a href="skill.htm">skill</a> of thousands of <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers, to a certain<br/>
standard of culture reached by the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing <a href="class.htm">class</a> as a whole--to the<br/>
labours, in short, of men in every corner of the globe.<br/>
<br/>
The Italians who died of cholera while making the Suez Canal, or of<br/>
anchylosis in the St. Gothard Tunnel, and the Americans mowed down by<br/>
shot and shell while fighting for the abolition of slavery, have helped<br/>
to <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>elop the cotton industry of France and Eng<a href="land.htm">land</a>, as well as the<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>-girls who <a href="lang.htm">lang</a>uish in the <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies of Manchester and Rouen, and<br/>
the inventor who <small>(following the suggestion of some <a href="work.htm">work</a>er)</small> succeeds in<br/>
improving the looms.<br/>
<br/>
How then, shall <a href="we.htm">we</a> estimate the <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e of each in the riches which ALL<br/>
contribute to amass?<br/>
<br/>
Looking at <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion from this general, synthetic <a href="point.htm">point</a> of view, <a href="we.htm">we</a><br/>
cannot <a href="hold.htm">hold</a> with the Collectivists that <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment pro<a href="port.htm">port</a>ionate to the<br/>
hours of labour rendered by each would be an ideal arrangement, or even<br/>
a step in the right direction.<br/>
<br/>
Without discussing whether <a href="exch.htm">exch</a>ange <a href="valu.htm">valu</a>e of <a href="good.htm">good</a>s is really measured in<br/>
existing societies by the amount of <a href="work.htm">work</a> necessary to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e<br/>
it--according to the teaching of Adam Smith and Ricardo, in whose<br/>
footsteps Marx has followed--suffice it to say here, leaving <a href="our.htm">our</a>selves<br/>
<a href="free.htm">free</a> to <a href="return.htm">return</a> to the subject <a href="late.htm">late</a>r, that the Collectivist ideal appears<br/>
to <a href="us.htm">us</a> untenable in a society which considers the <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ruments of labour<br/>
as a <a href="common.htm">common</a> inheritance. <a href="star.htm">Star</a>ting from this principle, such a society<br/>
would find itself forced from the very outset to abandon all forms of<br/>
<a href="wage.htm">wage</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
The migrated individualism of the Collectivist system certainly could<br/>
not maintain itself alongside a partial <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ism--the socialization of<br/>
<a href="land.htm">land</a> and the <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ruments of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion. A <a href="new.htm">new</a> form of <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty requires<br/>
a <a href="new.htm">new</a> form of remuneration. A <a href="new.htm">new</a> method of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion cannot exist side<br/>
by side with the <a href="old.htm">old</a> forms of <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>ption, any more than it can adapt<br/>
itself to the <a href="old.htm">old</a> forms of political <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="wage.htm">wage</a> system arises out of the individual <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of the <a href="land.htm">land</a> and<br/>
the <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ruments of labour. It was the necessary condition for the<br/>
<a href="dev.htm">dev</a>elopment of <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ist <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, and will perish with it, in spite<br/>
of the attempt to disguise it as "<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>-<a href="shar.htm">shar</a>ing." The <a href="common.htm">common</a><br/>
possession of the <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ruments of labour <a href="must.htm">must</a> necessarily bring with it<br/>
the enjoyment in <a href="common.htm">common</a> of the fruits of <a href="common.htm">common</a> labour.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> <a href="hold.htm">hold</a> further that <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ism is not only desirable, but that existing<br/>
societies, founded on Individualism, _are inevitably impelled in the<br/>
direction of <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ism_. The <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>elopment of Individualism during the<br/>
last three centuries is explained by the efforts of the individual to<br/>
<a href="protect.htm">protect</a> himself from the tyranny of <a href="capital.htm">Capital</a> and of the State. For a <a href="time.htm">time</a><br/>
he imagined, and those who expressed his thought for him declared, that<br/>
he could <a href="free.htm">free</a> himself entirely from the State and from society. "By<br/>
<a href="means.htm">means</a> of <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y," he said, "I can <a href="buy.htm">buy</a> all that I <a href="need.htm">need</a>." But the<br/>
individual was on a wrong track, and <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern history has taught him to<br/>
recognize that, without the help of all, he can do no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a>, although his<br/>
strong-boxes are full of <a href="gold.htm">gold</a>.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, along this <a href="cur.htm">cur</a><a href="rent.htm">rent</a> of Individualism, <a href="we.htm">we</a> find in all <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern<br/>
history a tendency, on the one hand to retain all that remains of the<br/>
partial <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ism of antiquity, and, on the other, to establish the<br/>
<a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ist principle in the thousand <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>elopments of <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern life.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as the <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>es of the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth centuries<br/>
had succeeded in emancipating themselves from their lords,<br/>
ecclesiastical or lay, their <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>al labour and <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>al <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>ption<br/>
began to extend and <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>elop rapidly. The township--and not private<br/>
<a href="person.htm">person</a>s--freighted ships and equipped expeditions, for the ex<a href="port.htm">port</a> of<br/>
their manufacture, and the <a href="bene.htm">bene</a>fit arising from the foreign <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e did<br/>
not accrue to individuals, but was <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>ed by all. At the outset, the<br/>
townships also bought provisions for all their citizens. Traces of these<br/>
<a href="inst.htm">inst</a>itutions have lingered on into the nineteenth century, and the<br/>
people piously cherish the memory of them in their legends.<br/>
<br/>
All that has disappeared. But the rural township still struggles to<br/>
pre<a href="serv.htm">serv</a>e the last traces of this <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ism, and it succeeds--except when<br/>
the State throws its heavy s<a href="word.htm">word</a> into the balance.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nizations, based on the same principle--_to every man<br/>
according to his <a href="need.htm">need</a>s_--spring up under a thousand diffe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> forms; for<br/>
without a certain leaven of <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ism the present societies could not<br/>
exist. In spite of the narrowly egoistic turn given to men's minds by<br/>
the <a href="commer.htm">commer</a>cial system, the tendency towards <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ism is constantly<br/>
appearing, and it influences <a href="our.htm">our</a> <a href="act.htm">act</a>ivities in a variety of ways.<br/>
<br/>
The bridges, for the <a href="use.htm">use</a> of which a toll was levied in the <a href="old.htm">old</a> days,<br/>
have become public <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty and are <a href="free.htm">free</a> to all; so are the high roads,<br/>
except in the East, where a toll is still exacted from the traveller for<br/>
every mile of his journey. Museums, <a href="free.htm">free</a> libraries, <a href="free.htm">free</a> schools, <a href="free.htm">free</a><br/>
meals for children; parks and gardens <a href="open.htm">open</a> to all; streets paved and<br/>
lighted, <a href="free.htm">free</a> to all; <a href="water.htm">water</a> supplied to every house without measure or<br/>
stint--all such arrangements are founded on the principle: "Take what<br/>
you <a href="need.htm">need</a>."<br/>
<br/>
The tramways and railways have already introduced monthly and annual<br/>
season tickets, without limiting the number of journeys taken; and two<br/>
nations, Hungary and Russia, have introduced on their railways the zone<br/>
system, which permits the <a href="hold.htm">hold</a>er to travel five hundred or eight hundred<br/>
miles for the same <a href="price.htm">price</a>. It is but a short step from that to a uniform<br/>
<a href="charg.htm">charg</a>e, such as already prevails in the postal <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ice. In all these<br/>
innovations, and in a thousand others, the tendency is not to measure<br/>
the individual <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>ption. One man <a href="want.htm">want</a>s to travel eight hundred miles,<br/>
another five hundred. These are <a href="person.htm">person</a>al requirements. There is no<br/>
sufficient reason why one should <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> twice as much as the other because<br/>
his <a href="need.htm">need</a> is twice as great. Such are the signs which appear even now in<br/>
<a href="our.htm">our</a> individualist societies.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, there is a tendency, though still a feeble one, to consider<br/>
the <a href="need.htm">need</a>s of the individual, irrespective of his <a href="past.htm">past</a> or possible<br/>
<a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ices to the <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ity. <a href="we.htm">We</a> are beginning to think of society as a<br/>
whole, each part of which is so intimately bound up with the others that<br/>
a <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ice rendered to one is a <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ice rendered to all.<br/>
<br/>
When you go to a public library--not indeed the National Library of<br/>
Paris, but, say, into the British Museum or the Berlin Library--the<br/>
librarian does not ask what <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ices you have rendered to society before<br/>
giving you the book, or the fifty books, which you require; he even<br/>
comes to your assistance if you do not know how to manage the catalogue.<br/>
By <a href="means.htm">means</a> of uniform credentials--and very often a contribution of <a href="work.htm">work</a><br/>
is preferred--the scientific society <a href="open.htm">open</a>s its museums, its gardens, its<br/>
library, its <a href="labor.htm">labor</a>atories, and its annual conversaziones to each of its<br/>
members, whether he be a Darwin, or a simple amateur.<br/>
<br/>
At St. Petersburg, if you are e<a href="labor.htm">labor</a>ating an invention, you go into a<br/>
special <a href="labor.htm">labor</a>atory, where you are given a place, a carpenter's bench, a<br/>
turning lathe, all the necessary tools and scientific <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ruments,<br/>
provided only you know how to <a href="use.htm">use</a> them; and you are allowed to <a href="work.htm">work</a><br/>
there as long as you please. There are the tools; <a href="interest.htm">interest</a> others in<br/>
your idea; <a href="join.htm">join</a> with fellow <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>ed in various crafts, or <a href="work.htm">work</a><br/>
alone if you prefer it. Invent a flying machine, or invent no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a>--that<br/>
is your <a href="own.htm">own</a> affair. You are pursuing an idea--that is enough.<br/>
<br/>
In the same way, those who man the lifeboat do not ask credentials from<br/>
the crew of a sinking ship; they launch their boat, risk their lives in<br/>
the raging waves, and some<a href="time.htm">time</a>s perish, all to save men whom they do not<br/>
even know. And what <a href="need.htm">need</a> to know them? "They are human beings, and they<br/>
<a href="need.htm">need</a> <a href="our.htm">our</a> aid--that is enough, that establishes their right---- To the<br/>
rescue!"<br/>
<br/>
Thus <a href="we.htm">we</a> find a tendency, eminently <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>istic, springing up on all<br/>
sides, and in various guises, in the very heart of theoretically<br/>
individualist societies.<br/>
<br/>
Suppose that one of <a href="our.htm">our</a> great cities, so egotistic in ordinary <a href="time.htm">time</a>s,<br/>
were visited to-morrow by some calamity--a siege, for <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ance--that<br/>
same sel<a href="fish.htm">fish</a> city would decide that the first <a href="need.htm">need</a>s to satisfy were<br/>
those of the children and the aged. Without asking what <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ices they<br/>
had rendered, or were likely to render to society, it would first of all<br/>
feed them. Then the combatants would be cared for, irrespective of the<br/>
courage or the intelligence which each had displayed, and thousands of<br/>
men and women would outvie each other in unsel<a href="fish.htm">fish</a> <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>otion to the<br/>
wounded.<br/>
<br/>
This tendency exists, and is felt as soon as the most pressing <a href="need.htm">need</a>s of<br/>
each are satisfied, and in pro<a href="port.htm">port</a>ion as the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive power of the<br/>
race increases. It becomes an <a href="act.htm">act</a>ive force every <a href="time.htm">time</a> a great idea comes<br/>
to oust the mean preoccupations of everyday life.<br/>
<br/>
How can <a href="we.htm">we</a> doubt, then, that when the <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ruments of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion are<br/>
placed at the <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ice of all, when business is conducted on <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ist<br/>
principles, when labour, having recovered its place of honour in<br/>
society, <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>es much more than is necessary to all--how can <a href="we.htm">we</a> doubt<br/>
that this force <small>(already so powerful)</small>, will enlarge its sphere of <a href="act.htm">act</a>ion<br/>
till it becomes the ruling principle of social life?<br/>
<br/>
Following these indications, and considering further the practical side<br/>
of expropriation, of which <a href="we.htm">we</a> shall speak in the following chapters, <a href="we.htm">we</a><br/>
are convinced that <a href="our.htm">our</a> first obligation, when the revolution shall have<br/>
broken the power up<a href="hold.htm">hold</a>ing the present system, will be to realize<br/>
<a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ism without delay.<br/>
<br/>
But <a href="our.htm">our</a>s is neither the <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ism of Fourier and the Phalansteriens, nor<br/>
of the German State Socialists. It is Anarchist <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ism, <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ism<br/>
without government--the <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ism of the <a href="free.htm">Free</a>. It is the synthesis of<br/>
the two ideals pursued by humanity throughout the ages--<a href="econ.htm">Econ</a>omic and<br/>
Political Liberty.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
II<br/>
<br/>
In taking "Anarchy" for <a href="our.htm">our</a> ideal of political <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization <a href="we.htm">we</a> are only<br/>
giving expression to another marked tendency of human progress. Whenever<br/>
European societies have <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>eloped up to a certain <a href="point.htm">point</a>, they have<br/>
shaken off the yoke of authority and substituted a system founded more<br/>
or less on the principles of individual liberty. And history shows <a href="us.htm">us</a><br/>
that these periods of partial or general revolution, when the <a href="old.htm">old</a><br/>
governments were o<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>hrown, were also periods of sudden, progress <a href="bot.htm">bot</a>h<br/>
in the <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic and the intellectual field. So it was after the<br/>
enfranchisement of the <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>es, whose monuments, <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed by the <a href="free.htm">free</a><br/>
labour of the guilds, have never been sur<a href="pass.htm">pass</a>ed; so it was after the<br/>
great peasant uprising which brought about the Reformation and<br/>
imperilled the papacy; and so it was again with the society, <a href="free.htm">free</a> for a<br/>
brief space, which was <a href="creat.htm">creat</a>ed on the other side of the Atlantic by the<br/>
malcontents from the <a href="old.htm">Old</a> world.<br/>
<br/>
And, if <a href="we.htm">we</a> ob<a href="serv.htm">serv</a>e the present <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>elopment of civilized nations, <a href="we.htm">we</a> see,<br/>
most unmistakably, a movement ever more and more marked tending to limit<br/>
the sphere of <a href="act.htm">act</a>ion of the Government, and to allow more and more<br/>
liberty to the individual. This evolution is going on before <a href="our.htm">our</a> eyes,<br/>
though cumbered by the ruins and rubbish of <a href="old.htm">old</a> <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>itutions and <a href="old.htm">old</a><br/>
superstitions. Like all evolutions, it only waits a revolution to<br/>
o<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>hrow the <a href="old.htm">old</a> obstacles which b<a href="lock.htm">lock</a> the way, that it may find <a href="free.htm">free</a><br/>
scope in a regenerated society.<br/>
<br/>
After having striven long in vain to <a href="solv.htm">solv</a>e the in<a href="solu.htm">solu</a>ble problem--the<br/>
problem of constructing a government "which will constrain the<br/>
individual to obedience without itself ceasing to be the <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ant of<br/>
society," men at last attempt to <a href="free.htm">free</a> themselves from every form of<br/>
government and to satisfy their <a href="need.htm">need</a> for <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization by <a href="free.htm">free</a> contacts<br/>
between individuals and <a href="group.htm">group</a>s pursuing the same aim. The independence<br/>
of each small territorial unit becomes a pressing <a href="need.htm">need</a>; mutual <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment<br/>
replaces <a href="law.htm">law</a> in order to regu<a href="late.htm">late</a> individual <a href="interest.htm">interest</a>s in view of a<br/>
<a href="common.htm">common</a> <a href="object.htm">object</a>--very often disregarding the frontiers of the present<br/>
States.<br/>
<br/>
All that was once looked on as a function of the Government is to-day<br/>
called in question. <a href="thing.htm">Thing</a>s are arranged more easily and more<br/>
satis<a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ily without the intervention of the State. And in studying<br/>
the progress made in this direction, <a href="we.htm">we</a> are led to conclude that the<br/>
tendency of the human race is to reduce Government interference to zero;<br/>
in fact, to abolish the State, the <a href="person.htm">person</a>ification of injustice,<br/>
oppression, and monopoly.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> can already catch glimpses of a world in which the bonds which bind<br/>
the individual are no longer <a href="law.htm">law</a>s, but social habits--the result of the<br/>
<a href="need.htm">need</a> felt by each one of <a href="us.htm">us</a> to seek the sup<a href="port.htm">port</a>, the co-operation, the<br/>
sympathy of his neighbours.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="assur.htm">Assur</a>edly the idea of a society without a State will give rise to at<br/>
least as many <a href="object.htm">object</a>ions as the political <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy of a society without<br/>
private <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>. <a href="we.htm">We</a> have all been brought up from <a href="our.htm">our</a> childhood to<br/>
regard the State as a <a href="sort.htm">sort</a> of Providence; all <a href="our.htm">our</a> education, the Roman<br/>
history <a href="we.htm">we</a> learned at school, the Byzantine <a href="code.htm">code</a> which <a href="we.htm">we</a> studied <a href="late.htm">late</a>r<br/>
under the <a href="name.htm">name</a> of Roman <a href="law.htm">law</a>, and the various sciences taught at the<br/>
universities, ac<a href="cust.htm">cust</a>om <a href="us.htm">us</a> to believe in Government and in the <a href="virt.htm">virt</a>ues of<br/>
the State providential.<br/>
<br/>
To maintain this superstition whole systems of philosophy have been<br/>
e<a href="labor.htm">labor</a>ated and taught; all politics are based on this principle; and<br/>
each politician, whatever his colours, comes forward and says to the<br/>
people, "Give my party the power; <a href="we.htm">we</a> can and <a href="we.htm">we</a> will <a href="free.htm">free</a> you from the<br/>
miseries which press so heavily upon you."<br/>
<br/>
From the cradle to the grave all <a href="our.htm">our</a> <a href="act.htm">act</a>ions are guided by this<br/>
principle. <a href="open.htm">Open</a> any book on sociology or jurisprudence, and you will<br/>
find there the Government, its <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization, its <a href="act.htm">act</a>s, filling so large<br/>
a place that <a href="we.htm">we</a> come to believe that there is no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> outside the<br/>
Government and the world of statesmen.<br/>
<br/>
The Press teaches <a href="us.htm">us</a> the same in every conceivable way. Whole columns<br/>
are <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>oted to parliamentary debates and to political intrigues; while<br/>
the vast everyday life of a nation appears only in the columns given to<br/>
<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic subjects, or in the pages <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>oted to re<a href="port.htm">port</a>s of police and <a href="law.htm">law</a><br/>
cases. And when you read the <a href="new.htm">new</a>spapers, your hardly think of the<br/>
incalculable number of beings--all humanity, so to say--who <a href="grow.htm">grow</a> up and<br/>
die, who know sorrow, who <a href="work.htm">work</a> and <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>e, think and <a href="creat.htm">creat</a>e outside the<br/>
few encumbering <a href="person.htm">person</a>ages who have been so magnified that humanity is<br/>
hidden by their shadows, enlarged by <a href="our.htm">our</a> ignorance.<br/>
<br/>
And yet as soon as <a href="we.htm">we</a> <a href="pass.htm">pass</a> from <a href="print.htm">print</a>ed <a href="matt.htm">matt</a>er to life itself, as soon<br/>
as <a href="we.htm">we</a> throw a glance at society, <a href="we.htm">we</a> are struck by the infinitesimal part<br/>
played by the Government. Balzac already has remarked how millions of<br/>
peasants spend the whole of their lives without knowing any<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> about<br/>
the State, save the heavy <a href="tax.htm">tax</a>es they are compelled to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>. Every day<br/>
millions of <a href="trans.htm">trans</a><a href="act.htm">act</a>ions are made without Government intervention, and<br/>
the greatest of them--those of <a href="commer.htm">commer</a>ce and of the <a href="exch.htm">Exch</a>ange--are carried<br/>
on in such a way that the Government could not be appealed to if one of<br/>
the contracting parties had the intention of not fulfilling his<br/>
<a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment. Should you speak to a man who understands <a href="commer.htm">commer</a>ce, he will<br/>
tell you that the everyday business <a href="trans.htm">trans</a><a href="act.htm">act</a>ed by merchants would be<br/>
ab<a href="solu.htm">solu</a>tely impossible were it not based on mutual confidence. The habit<br/>
of keeping his <a href="word.htm">word</a>, the desire not to lose his credit, amply suffice to<br/>
maintain this relative honesty. The man who does not feel the slightest<br/>
remorse when poisoning his <a href="cust.htm">cust</a>omers with noxious <a href="drug.htm">drug</a>s covered with<br/>
pompous labels, thinks he is in honour bound to keep his engagements.<br/>
But if this relative morality has <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>eloped under present conditions,<br/>
when enrichment is the only incentive and the only aim, can <a href="we.htm">we</a> doubt its<br/>
rapid progress when appropriation of the fruits of others' labour will<br/>
no longer be the basis of society?<br/>
<br/>
Another striking fact, which especially characterizes <a href="our.htm">our</a> generation,<br/>
speaks still more in favour of <a href="our.htm">our</a> ideas. It is the continual extension<br/>
of the field of enterprise due to private initiative, and the prodigious<br/>
<a href="dev.htm">dev</a>elopment of <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nizations of all kinds. <a href="we.htm">We</a> shall discuss this<br/>
more at length in the chapter <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>oted to _<a href="free.htm">Free</a> <a href="agree.htm">Agree</a>ment_. Suffice it to<br/>
mention that the facts are so numerous and so <a href="cust.htm">cust</a>omary that they are<br/>
the essence of the s<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>d half of the nineteenth century, even though<br/>
political and socialist writers ignore them, always preferring to talk<br/>
to <a href="us.htm">us</a> about the functions of the Government.<br/>
<br/>
These <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nizations, <a href="free.htm">free</a> and infinitely varied, are so natural an<br/>
outcome of <a href="our.htm">our</a> civilization; they expand so rapidly and federate with<br/>
so much ease; they are so necessary a result of the continual <a href="grow.htm">grow</a>th of<br/>
the <a href="need.htm">need</a>s of civilized man; and lastly, they so advantageously replace<br/>
governmental interference, that <a href="we.htm">we</a> <a href="must.htm">must</a> recognize in them a <a href="factor.htm">factor</a> of<br/>
<a href="grow.htm">grow</a>ing im<a href="port.htm">port</a>ance in the life of societies. If they do not yet spread<br/>
over the whole of the manifestations of life, it is that they find an<br/>
<a href="insur.htm">insur</a>mountable obstacle in the po<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>y of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er, in the divisions<br/>
of present society, in the private appropriation of <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>, and in the<br/>
State. Abolish these obstacles, and you will see them covering the<br/>
immense field of civilized man's <a href="act.htm">act</a>ivity.<br/>
<br/>
The history of the last fifty years furnishes a living proof that<br/>
Representative Government is im<a href="potent.htm">potent</a> to dis<a href="charg.htm">charg</a>e all the functions <a href="we.htm">we</a><br/>
have sought to assign to it. In days to come the nineteenth century will<br/>
be quoted as having witnessed the failure of parliamentarianism.<br/>
<br/>
This impotence is becoming so evident to all; the faults of<br/>
parliamentarianism, and the inhe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> vices of the representative<br/>
principle, are so self-evident, that the few thinkers who have made a<br/>
critical study of them <small>(J. S. Mill, Leverdays)</small>, did but give literary<br/>
form to the popular dissatisfaction. It is not difficult, indeed, to see<br/>
the absurdity of naming a few men and saying to them, "<a href="make.htm">Make</a> <a href="law.htm">law</a>s<br/>
regulating all <a href="our.htm">our</a> spheres of <a href="act.htm">act</a>ivity, although not one of you knows<br/>
any<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> about them!"<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> are beginning to see that government by majorities <a href="means.htm">means</a> abandoning<br/>
all the affairs of the country to the tide-waiters who <a href="make.htm">make</a> up the<br/>
majorities in the House and in election <a href="commit.htm">commit</a>tees; to those, in a <a href="word.htm">word</a>,<br/>
who have no opinion of their <a href="own.htm">own</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Mankind is seeking and already finding <a href="new.htm">new</a> issues. The International<br/>
Postal Union, the railway unions, and the learned societies give <a href="us.htm">us</a><br/>
examples of <a href="solu.htm">solu</a>tions based on <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment in place and stead of <a href="law.htm">law</a>.<br/>
<br/>
To-day, when <a href="group.htm">group</a>s scattered far and wide wish to <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nize themselves<br/>
for some <a href="object.htm">object</a> or other, they no longer elect an international<br/>
parliament of Jacks-of-all-<a href="trad.htm">trad</a>es. They proceed in a diffe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> way.<br/>
Where it is not possible to meet directly or come to an <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment by<br/>
correspondence, delegates versed in the question at issue are sent, and<br/>
they are told: "Endeavour to come to an <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment on such or such a<br/>
question, and then <a href="return.htm">return</a>, not with a <a href="law.htm">law</a> in your pocket, but with a<br/>
proposition of <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment which <a href="we.htm">we</a> may or may not accept."<br/>
<br/>
Such is the method of the great industrial companies, the learned<br/>
societies, and numerous associations of every description, which already<br/>
cover Europe and the United States. And such will be the method of a<br/>
<a href="free.htm">free</a> society. A society founded on serfdom is in keeping with ab<a href="solu.htm">solu</a>te<br/>
monarchy; a society based on the <a href="wage.htm">wage</a> system and the exploitation of the<br/>
masses by the <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ists finds its political expression in<br/>
parliamentarianism. But a <a href="free.htm">free</a> society, regaining possession of the<br/>
<a href="common.htm">common</a> inheritance, <a href="must.htm">must</a> seek in <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="group.htm">group</a>s and <a href="free.htm">free</a> federations of<br/>
<a href="group.htm">group</a>s, a <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization, in harmony with the <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic phase of<br/>
history.<br/>
<br/>
Every <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic phase has a political phase corresponding to it, and it<br/>
would be impossible to touch private <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty unless a <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>e of<br/>
political life be found at the same <a href="time.htm">time</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
CHAPTER IV<br/>
<br/>
EXPROPRIATION<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I<br/>
<br/>
It is told of <a href="rot.htm">Rot</a>hschild that, seeing his fortune threatened by the<br/>
Revolution of 1848, he hit upon the following stratagem: "I am quite<br/>
willing to admit," said he, "that my fortune has been accumu<a href="late.htm">late</a>d at the<br/>
expense of others; but if it were divided to-morrow among the millions<br/>
of Europe, the <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e of each would only amount to four shillings. Very<br/>
well, then, I undertake to render to each his four shillings if he asks<br/>
me for it."<br/>
<br/>
Having given due publicity to his <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>e, <a href="our.htm">our</a> millionaire proceeded as<br/>
usual to stroll quietly through the streets of Frankfort. Three or four<br/>
<a href="pass.htm">pass</a>ers-by asked for their four shillings, which he disbursed with a<br/>
sardonic smile. His stratagem succeeded, and the family of the<br/>
millionaire is still in possession of its wealth.<br/>
<br/>
It is in much the same fashion that the shrewed heads among the middle<br/>
<a href="class.htm">class</a>es reason when they say, "Ah, Expropriation! I know what that<br/>
<a href="means.htm">means</a>. You take all the overcoats and lay them in a heap, and every one<br/>
is <a href="free.htm">free</a> to help himself and fight for the best."<br/>
<br/>
But such jests are irrelevant as well as flippant. What <a href="we.htm">we</a> <a href="want.htm">want</a> is not a<br/>
redistribution of overcoats, although it <a href="must.htm">must</a> be said that even in such<br/>
a case, the shivering folk would see advantage in it. Nor do <a href="we.htm">we</a> <a href="want.htm">want</a> to<br/>
divide up the wealth of the <a href="rot.htm">Rot</a>hschilds. What <a href="we.htm">we</a> do <a href="want.htm">want</a> is so to<br/>
arrange <a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s that every human being born into the world shall be<br/>
ensured the op<a href="port.htm">port</a>unity, in the first <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ance of learning some <a href="use.htm">use</a>ful<br/>
occupation, and of becoming <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>ed in it; and next, that he shall be<br/>
<a href="free.htm">free</a> to <a href="work.htm">work</a> at his <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e without asking leave of master or <a href="own.htm">own</a>er, and<br/>
without handing over to <a href="land.htm">land</a>lord or <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ist the lion's <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e of what<br/>
he <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>es. As to the wealth held by the <a href="rot.htm">Rot</a>hschilds or the<br/>
Vanderbilts, it will <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>e <a href="us.htm">us</a> to <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nize <a href="our.htm">our</a> system of <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>al<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
The day when the labourer may till the ground without <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing away half<br/>
of what he <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>es, the day when the machines necessary to prepare the<br/>
soil for rich har<a href="vest.htm">vest</a>s are at the <a href="free.htm">free</a> disposal of the cultivators, the<br/>
day when the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er in the <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>y <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>es for the <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ity and not<br/>
the monopolist--that day will see the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>ed and fed, and there<br/>
will be no more <a href="rot.htm">Rot</a>hschilds or other exploiters.<br/>
<br/>
No one will then have to <a href="sell.htm">sell</a> his <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing power for a <a href="wage.htm">wage</a> that only<br/>
represents a fraction of what he <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
"So far, so <a href="good.htm">good</a>," say <a href="our.htm">our</a> critics, "but you will have <a href="rot.htm">Rot</a>hschilds<br/>
coming in from the outside. How are you to prevent a <a href="person.htm">person</a> from<br/>
amassing millions in China, and then settling amongst you? How are you<br/>
going to prevent such a one from surrounding himself with lackeys and<br/>
<a href="wage.htm">wage</a>-slaves--from exploiting them and enriching himself at their<br/>
expense?<br/>
<br/>
"You cannot bring about a revolution all over the world at the same<br/>
<a href="time.htm">time</a>. Well, then--are you going to establish <a href="cust.htm">cust</a>om-houses on your<br/>
frontiers to search all who enter your country and confiscate the <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y<br/>
they bring with them?--Anarchist policemen firing on travellers would be<br/>
a fine spectacle!"<br/>
<br/>
But at the root of this argument there is a great error. Those who<br/>
propound it have never paused to inquire whence come the fortunes of the<br/>
rich. A little thought would, however, suffice to show them that these<br/>
fortunes have their beginnings in the po<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>y of the poor. When there<br/>
are no longer any destitute, there will no longer be any rich to exploit<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Let <a href="us.htm">us</a> glance for a moment at the Middle Ages, when great fortunes began<br/>
to spring up.<br/>
<br/>
A feudal baron seizes on a fertile valley. But as long as the fertile<br/>
valley is empty of folk <a href="our.htm">our</a> baron is not rich. His <a href="land.htm">land</a> brings him in<br/>
no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a>; he might as well possess a <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty in the moon.<br/>
<br/>
What does <a href="our.htm">our</a> baron do to enrich himself? He looks out for peasants--for<br/>
poor peasants!<br/>
<br/>
If every peasant-<a href="farm.htm">farm</a>er had a piece of <a href="land.htm">land</a>, <a href="free.htm">free</a> from <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> and <a href="tax.htm">tax</a>es,<br/>
if he had in addition the tools and the stock necessary for <a href="farm.htm">farm</a><br/>
labour--Who would plough the <a href="land.htm">land</a>s of the baron? Everyone would look<br/>
after his <a href="own.htm">own</a>. But there are thousands of destitute <a href="person.htm">person</a>s ruined by<br/>
wars, or drought, or pestilence. They have neither horse nor plough.<br/>
<small>(Iron was very <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>ly in the Middle Ages, and a draught-horse still more<br/>
so.)</small><br/>
<br/>
All these destitute <a href="creat.htm">creat</a>ures are trying to better their condition. One<br/>
day they see on the road at the confines of <a href="our.htm">our</a> baron's estate a<br/>
notice-board indicating by certain signs adapted to their comprehension<br/>
that the labourer who is willing to settle on his estate will receive<br/>
the tools and <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ials to build his cottage and sow his fields, and a<br/>
<a href="port.htm">port</a>ion of <a href="land.htm">land</a> <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> <a href="free.htm">free</a> for a certain number of years. The number of<br/>
years is represented by so many <a href="cross.htm">cross</a>es on the sign-board, and the<br/>
peasant understands the meaning of these <a href="cross.htm">cross</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
So the poor wretches come to settle on the baron's <a href="land.htm">land</a>s. They <a href="make.htm">make</a><br/>
roads, drain the marshes, build villages. In nine or ten years the baron<br/>
begins to <a href="tax.htm">tax</a> them. Five years <a href="late.htm">late</a>r he increases the <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>. Then he<br/>
doubles it, and the peasant accepts these <a href="new.htm">new</a> conditions because he<br/>
cannot find better ones elsewhere. Little by little, with the aid of<br/>
<a href="law.htm">law</a>s made by the barons, the po<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>y of the peasant becomes the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e<br/>
of the <a href="land.htm">land</a>lord's wealth. And it is not only the lord of the manor who<br/>
preys upon him. A whole host of <a href="usur.htm">usur</a>ers swoop down upon the villages,<br/>
multiplying as the wretchedness of the peasants increases. That is how<br/>
these <a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s happened in the Middle Ages. And to-day is it not still the<br/>
same <a href="thing.htm">thing</a>? If there were <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="land.htm">land</a>s which the peasant could cultivate<br/>
if he pleased, would he <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> £50 to some "shabble of a Duke"<small>[2]</small> for<br/>
condescending to <a href="sell.htm">sell</a> him a scrap? Would he burden himself with a lease<br/>
which absorbed a third of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e? Would he--on the _métayer_<br/>
system--consent to give half of his har<a href="vest.htm">vest</a> to the <a href="land.htm">land</a><a href="own.htm">own</a>er?<br/>
<br/>
But he has no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a>. So he will accept any conditions, if only he can<br/>
keep body and soul together, while he tills the soil and enriches the<br/>
<a href="land.htm">land</a>lord.<br/>
<br/>
So in the nineteenth century, just as in the Middle Ages, the po<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>y of<br/>
the peasant is a <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e of wealth to the <a href="land.htm">land</a>ed proprietor.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
II<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="land.htm">land</a>lord owes his riches to the po<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>y of the peasants, and the<br/>
wealth of the <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ist comes from the same <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
Take the case of a citizen of the middle <a href="class.htm">class</a>, who somehow or other<br/>
finds himself in possession of £20,000. He could, of course, spend his<br/>
<a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y at the rate of £2,000 a year, a mere bagatelle in these days of<br/>
fantastic, senseless luxury. But then he would have no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> left at the<br/>
end of ten years. So, being a "practical <a href="person.htm">person</a>," he prefers to keep his<br/>
fortune intact, and <a href="win.htm">win</a> for himself a snug little annual income as well.<br/>
<br/>
This is very easy in <a href="our.htm">our</a> society, for the <a href="good.htm">good</a> reason that the towns and<br/>
villages swarm with <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers who have not the wherewithal to live for a<br/>
month, or even a fortnight. So <a href="our.htm">our</a> <a href="worth.htm">worth</a>y citizen <a href="star.htm">star</a>ts a <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>y. The<br/>
banks hasten to lend him another £20,000, especially if he has a<br/>
reputation for "business ability"; and with this round sum he can<br/>
command the labour of five hundred hands.<br/>
<br/>
If all the men and women in the countryside had their daily <a href="bread.htm">bread</a><br/>
<a href="assur.htm">assur</a>ed, and their daily <a href="need.htm">need</a>s already satisfied, who would <a href="work.htm">work</a> for <a href="our.htm">our</a><br/>
<a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ist at a <a href="wage.htm">wage</a> of half a crown a day, while the commodities one<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>es in a day <a href="sell.htm">sell</a> in the market for a crown or more?<br/>
<br/>
Unhappily--<a href="we.htm">we</a> know it all too well--the poor quarters of <a href="our.htm">our</a> towns and<br/>
the neighbouring villages are full of <a href="need.htm">need</a>y wretches, whose children<br/>
clamour for <a href="bread.htm">bread</a>. So, before the <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>y is well finished, the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers<br/>
hasten to offer themselves. Where a hundred are required three hundred<br/>
besiege the doors, and from the <a href="time.htm">time</a> his mill is <a href="star.htm">star</a>ted, the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er, if<br/>
he only has average business capacities, will clear £40 a year out of<br/>
each mill-hand he <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
He is thus able to lay by a snug little fortune; and if he chooses a<br/>
lucrative <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e, and has "business talents," he will soon increase his<br/>
income by doubling the number of men he exploits.<br/>
<br/>
So he becomes a <a href="person.htm">person</a>age of im<a href="port.htm">port</a>ance. He can afford to give dinners<br/>
to other <a href="person.htm">person</a>ages--to the local magnates, the civic, legal, and<br/>
political dignitaries. With his <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y he can "marry <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y"; by and by he<br/>
may pick and choose places for his children, and <a href="late.htm">late</a>r on perhaps get<br/>
some<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> <a href="good.htm">good</a> from the Government--a contract for the army or for the<br/>
police. His <a href="gold.htm">gold</a> breeds <a href="gold.htm">gold</a>; till at last a war, or even a rumour of<br/>
war, or a speculation on the Stock <a href="exch.htm">Exch</a>ange, gives him his great<br/>
op<a href="port.htm">port</a>unity.<br/>
<br/>
Nine-tenths of the great fortunes made in the United States are <small>(as<br/>
Henry George has shown in his "Social Problems")</small> the result of knavery<br/>
on a large scale, assisted by the State. In Europe, nine-tenths of the<br/>
fortunes made in <a href="our.htm">our</a> monarchies and republics have the same origin.<br/>
There are not two ways of becoming a millionaire.<br/>
<br/>
This is the secret of wealth: find the <a href="star.htm">star</a>ving and destitute, <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> them<br/>
half a crown, and <a href="make.htm">make</a> them <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e five shillings <a href="worth.htm">worth</a> in the day,<br/>
amass a fortune by these <a href="means.htm">means</a>, and then increase it by some lucky<br/>
speculation, made with the help of the State.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="need.htm">Need</a> <a href="we.htm">we</a> go on to speak of small fortunes attributed by the <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omists to<br/>
forethought and frugality, when <a href="we.htm">we</a> know that mere saving in itself<br/>
brings in no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a>, so long as the pence saved are not <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to exploit<br/>
the famishing?<br/>
<br/>
Take a shoe<a href="make.htm">make</a>r, for <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ance. Grant that his <a href="work.htm">work</a> is well <a href="paid.htm">paid</a>, that<br/>
he has plenty of <a href="cust.htm">cust</a>om, and that by dint of strict frugality he<br/>
contrives to lay by from eighteen pence to two shillings a day, perhaps<br/>
two pounds a month.<br/>
<br/>
Grant that <a href="our.htm">our</a> shoe<a href="make.htm">make</a>r is never ill, that he does not half <a href="star.htm">star</a>ve<br/>
himself, in spite of his <a href="pass.htm">pass</a>ion for <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy; that he does not marry or<br/>
that he has no children; that he does not die of <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>ption; suppose<br/>
any<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> and every<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> you please!<br/>
<br/>
Well, at the age of fifty he will not have scraped together £800; and<br/>
he will not have enough to live on during his <a href="old.htm">old</a> age, when he is <a href="past.htm">past</a><br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>. <a href="assur.htm">Assur</a>edly this is not how fortunes are made. But suppose <a href="our.htm">our</a><br/>
shoe<a href="make.htm">make</a>r, as soon as he has laid by a few pence, thriftily conveys them<br/>
to the savings bank and that the savings bank lends them to the<br/>
<a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ist who is just about to "<a href="employ.htm">employ</a> labour," i.e., to exploit the<br/>
poor. Then <a href="our.htm">our</a> shoe<a href="make.htm">make</a>r takes an app<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ice, the child of some poor<br/>
wretch, who will think himself lucky if in five years' <a href="time.htm">time</a> his son has<br/>
learned the <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e and is able to earn his living.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile <a href="our.htm">our</a> shoe<a href="make.htm">make</a>r does not lose by him, and if <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e is brisk he<br/>
soon takes a s<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>d, and then a third app<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ice. By and by he will take<br/>
two or three <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing men--poor wretches, thankful to receive half a<br/>
crown a day for <a href="work.htm">work</a> that is <a href="worth.htm">worth</a> five shillings, and if <a href="our.htm">our</a> shoe<a href="make.htm">make</a>r<br/>
is "in luck," that is to say, if he is keen enough and mean enough, his<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>ing men and app<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ices will bring him in n<a href="early.htm">early</a> one pound a day,<br/>
over and above the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t of his <a href="own.htm">own</a> toil. He can then enlarge his<br/>
business. He will gradually become rich, and no longer have any <a href="need.htm">need</a> to<br/>
stint himself in the necessaries of life. He will leave a snug little<br/>
fortune to his son.<br/>
<br/>
That is what people call "being <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omical and having frugal, temperate<br/>
habits." At <a href="bot.htm">bot</a>tom it is no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> more nor less than grinding the face of<br/>
the poor.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="commer.htm">Commer</a>ce seems an exception to this rule. "Such a man," <a href="we.htm">we</a> are told,<br/>
"<a href="buy.htm">buy</a>s tea in China, brings it to France, and realizes a <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> of thirty<br/>
per cent. on his original outlay. He has exploited nobody."<br/>
<br/>
Ne<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>heless the case is quite similar. If <a href="our.htm">our</a> merchant had carried his<br/>
bales on his back, well and <a href="good.htm">good</a>! In <a href="early.htm">early</a> medieval <a href="time.htm">time</a>s that was<br/>
exactly how foreign <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e was conducted, and so no one reached such<br/>
giddy heights of fortune as in <a href="our.htm">our</a> days. Very few and very hardly earned<br/>
were the <a href="gold.htm">gold</a> <a href="coin.htm">coin</a>s which the medieval merchant gained from a long and<br/>
dangerous voyage. It was less the love of <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y than the thirst of<br/>
travel and adventure that inspired his undertakings.<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays the method is simpler. A merchant who has some <a href="capital.htm">capital</a> <a href="need.htm">need</a> not<br/>
stir from his desk to become wealthy. He telegraphs to an agent telling<br/>
him to <a href="buy.htm">buy</a> a hundred tons of tea; he freights a ship, and in a few<br/>
weeks, in three months if it is a sailing ship, the vessels brings him<br/>
his cargo. He does not even take the risks of the voyage, for his tea<br/>
and his vessel are <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ed, and if he has expended four thousand pounds<br/>
he will receive more than five or six thousand; that is to say, if he<br/>
has not attempted to specu<a href="late.htm">late</a> in some novel commodities, in which case<br/>
he runs a chance of either doubling his fortune or losing it altogether.<br/>
<br/>
Now, how could he find men willing to <a href="cross.htm">cross</a> the sea, to travel to China<br/>
and back, to endure hardship and slavish toil and to risk their lives<br/>
for a miserable pittance? How could he find dock labourers willing to<br/>
load and unload his ships for "<a href="star.htm">star</a>vation <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>s"? How? Because they are<br/>
<a href="need.htm">need</a>y and <a href="star.htm">star</a>ving. Go to the sea<a href="port.htm">port</a>s, visit the cook-shops and taverns<br/>
on the quays, and look at these men who have come to hire themselves,<br/>
<a href="crowd.htm">crowd</a>ing round the dock-gates, which they besiege from <a href="early.htm">early</a> dawn,<br/>
hoping to be allowed to <a href="work.htm">work</a> on the vessels. Look at these sailors,<br/>
happy to be hired for a long voyage, after weeks and months of waiting.<br/>
All their lives long they have gone to the sea in ships, and they will<br/>
sail in others still, until they have perished in the waves.<br/>
<br/>
Enter their homes, look at their wives and children in rags, living one<br/>
knows not how till the father's <a href="return.htm">return</a>, and you will have the answer to<br/>
the question.<br/>
<br/>
Multiply examples, choose them where you will, consider the origin of<br/>
all fortunes, large or small, whether arising out of <a href="commer.htm">commer</a>ce, finance,<br/>
manufacturers, or the <a href="land.htm">land</a>. Everywhere you will find that the wealth of<br/>
the wealthy springs from the po<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>y of the poor. This is why an<br/>
anarchist society <a href="need.htm">need</a> not fear the advent of a <a href="rot.htm">Rot</a>hschild who would<br/>
settle in its midst. If every member of the <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ity knows that after a<br/>
few hours of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive toil he will have a right to all the pleasures<br/>
that civilization procures, and to those deeper <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of enjoyment<br/>
which art and science offer to all who seek them, he will not <a href="sell.htm">sell</a> his<br/>
strength for a <a href="star.htm">star</a>vation <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>. No one will volunteer to <a href="work.htm">work</a> for the<br/>
enrichment of your <a href="rot.htm">Rot</a>hschild. His <a href="gold.htm">gold</a>en guineas will be only so many<br/>
pieces of <a href="meta.htm">meta</a>l--<a href="use.htm">use</a>ful for various purposes, but incapable of breeding<br/>
more.<br/>
<br/>
In answering the above <a href="object.htm">object</a>ion <a href="we.htm">we</a> have at the same <a href="time.htm">time</a> indicated the<br/>
scope of Expropriation. It <a href="must.htm">must</a> apply to every<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> that enables any<br/>
man--be he financier, mill-<a href="own.htm">own</a>er, or <a href="land.htm">land</a>lord--to appropriate the<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t of others' toil. <a href="our.htm">Our</a> formula is simple and comprehensive.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> do not <a href="want.htm">want</a> to rob any one of his coat, but <a href="we.htm">we</a> wish to give to the<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>ers all those <a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s the lack of which <a href="make.htm">make</a>s them fall an easy prey<br/>
to the exploiter, and <a href="we.htm">we</a> will do <a href="our.htm">our</a> utmost that none shall lack aught,<br/>
that not a single man shall be forced to <a href="sell.htm">sell</a> the strength of his right<br/>
arm to obtain a bare subsistence for himself and his babes. This is what<br/>
<a href="we.htm">we</a> mean when <a href="we.htm">we</a> talk of Expropriation; this will be <a href="our.htm">our</a> duty during the<br/>
Revolution, for whose coming <a href="we.htm">we</a> look, not two hundred years hence, but<br/>
soon, very soon.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
III<br/>
<br/>
The ideas of Anarchism in general and of Expropriation in particular<br/>
find much more sympathy than <a href="we.htm">we</a> are apt to imagine among men of<br/>
independent character, and those for whom idleness is not the supreme<br/>
ideal. "Still," <a href="our.htm">our</a> friends often warn <a href="us.htm">us</a>, "take care you do not go too<br/>
far! Humanity cannot be <a href="chang.htm">chang</a>ed in a day, so do not be in to great a<br/>
hurry with your schemes of Expropriation and Anarchy, or you will be in<br/>
danger of achieving no permanent result."<br/>
<br/>
Now, what <a href="we.htm">we</a> fear with regard to Expropriation is exactly the contrary.<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> are afraid of not going far enough, of <a href="carry.htm">carry</a>ing out Expropriation on<br/>
too small a scale to be lasting. <a href="we.htm">We</a> would not have the revolutionary<br/>
impulse arrested in mid-career, to exhaust itself in half measures,<br/>
which would content no one, and while <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing a tremendous confusion<br/>
in society, and stopping its <a href="cust.htm">cust</a>omary <a href="act.htm">act</a>ivities, would have no vital<br/>
power--would merely spread general discontent and inevitably prepare the<br/>
way for the triumph of reaction.<br/>
<br/>
There are, in fact, in a <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern State established relations which it is<br/>
practically impossible to <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify if one attacks them only in detail.<br/>
There are wheels within wheels in <a href="our.htm">our</a> <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization--the<br/>
machinery is so complex and interdependent that no one part can be<br/>
<a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified without disturbing the whole. This becomes clear as soon as an<br/>
attempt is made to expropriate any<a href="thing.htm">thing</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Let <a href="us.htm">us</a> suppose that in a certain country a limited form of expropriation<br/>
is effected. For example, that, as it has been suggested more than once,<br/>
only the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty of the great <a href="land.htm">land</a>lords is socialized, whilst the<br/>
<a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies are left untouched; or that, in a certain city, house <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty<br/>
is taken over by the <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>e, but every<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> else is left to private<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a>ership; or that, in some manufacturing centre, the <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies are<br/>
<a href="commun.htm">commun</a>alized, but the <a href="land.htm">land</a> is not interfered with.<br/>
<br/>
The same result would follow in each case--a terrible shattering of the<br/>
industrial system, without the <a href="means.htm">means</a> of re<a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nizing it on <a href="new.htm">new</a> lines.<br/>
Industry and finance would be at a dead<a href="lock.htm">lock</a>, yet a <a href="return.htm">return</a> to the first<br/>
principles of justice would not have been achieved, and society would<br/>
find itself powerless to construct a harmonious whole.<br/>
<br/>
If <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture were <a href="free.htm">free</a>d from great <a href="land.htm">land</a><a href="own.htm">own</a>ers, while industry still<br/>
remained the bond-slave of the <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ist, the merchant, and the banker,<br/>
no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> would be accomplished. The peasant suffers to-day not only in<br/>
having to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> to the <a href="land.htm">land</a>lord; he is oppressed on all hands by<br/>
existing conditions. He is exploited by the <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>esman, who <a href="make.htm">make</a>s him<br/>
<a href="pay.htm">pay</a> half a crown for a spade which, measured by the labour spent on it,<br/>
is not <a href="worth.htm">worth</a> more than sixpence. He is <a href="tax.htm">tax</a>ed by the State, which cannot<br/>
do without its formidable hierarchy of officials, and finds it necessary<br/>
to maintain an expensive army, because the <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ers of all nations are<br/>
perpetually fighting for the markets, and any day a little quarrel<br/>
arising from the exploitation of some part of Asia or Africa may result<br/>
in war.<br/>
<br/>
Then again the peasant suffers from the depopulation of country places:<br/>
the young people are attracted to the large manufacturing towns by the<br/>
bait of high <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>s <a href="paid.htm">paid</a> temporarily by the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ers of articles of<br/>
luxury, or by the attractions of a more stirring life. The artificial<br/>
<a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ion of industry, the industrial exploitation of foreign<br/>
countries, the prevalence of stock-jobbing, the difficulty of improving<br/>
the soil and the machinery of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion--all these agencies combine<br/>
nowadays to <a href="work.htm">work</a> aga<a href="inst.htm">inst</a> <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture, which is burdened not only by<br/>
<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>, but by the whole complex of conditions in a society based on<br/>
exploitation. Thus, even if the expropriation of <a href="land.htm">land</a> were accomplished,<br/>
and every one were <a href="free.htm">free</a> to till the soil and cultivate it to the best<br/>
advantage, without <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>, <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture, even though it should<br/>
enjoy--which can by no <a href="means.htm">means</a> be taken for granted--a momentary<br/>
prosperity, would soon fall back into the slough in which it finds<br/>
itself to-day. The whole <a href="thing.htm">thing</a> would have to be begun over again, with<br/>
increased difficulties.<br/>
<br/>
The same <a href="hold.htm">hold</a>s true of industry. Take the converse case: <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ead of<br/>
turning the <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>cultural labourers into peasant-proprietors,<br/>
<a href="make.htm">make</a> over the <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies to those who <a href="work.htm">work</a> in them. Abolish the<br/>
master-manufacturers, but leave the <a href="land.htm">land</a>lord his <a href="land.htm">land</a>, the banker his<br/>
<a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y, the merchant his <a href="exch.htm">Exch</a>ange; maintain the swarm of idlers who live<br/>
on the toil of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>men, the thousand and one middlemen, the State<br/>
with its numberless officials,--and industry would come to a standstill.<br/>
Finding no <a href="purch.htm">purch</a>asers in the mass of peasants who would remain poor; not<br/>
possessing the raw <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ial, and unable to ex<a href="port.htm">port</a> their <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e, partly<br/>
on account of the stoppage of <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e, and still more so because<br/>
industries spread all over the world, the manufacturers would feel<br/>
unable to struggle, and thousands of <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers would be thrown upon the<br/>
streets. These <a href="star.htm">star</a>ving <a href="crowd.htm">crowd</a>s would be ready and willing to submit to<br/>
the first schemer who came to exploit them; they would even consent to<br/>
<a href="return.htm">return</a> to the <a href="old.htm">old</a> slavery, under <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>e of guaranteed <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Or, finally, suppose you oust the <a href="land.htm">land</a><a href="own.htm">own</a>ers, and hand over the mills<br/>
and <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies to the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er, without interfering with the swarm of<br/>
middlemen who drain the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t of <a href="our.htm">our</a> manufacturers, and specu<a href="late.htm">late</a> in<br/>
corn and flour, meat and groceries, in <a href="our.htm">our</a> great centres of <a href="commer.htm">commer</a>ce.<br/>
Then, as soon as the <a href="exch.htm">exch</a>ange of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e is slackened; as soon as the<br/>
great cities are left without <a href="bread.htm">bread</a>, while the great manufacturing<br/>
centres find no <a href="buy.htm">buy</a>ers for the articles of luxury they <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e,--the<br/>
counter-revolution is bound to take place, and it would come, treading<br/>
upon the slain, sweeping the towns and villages with shot and shell;<br/>
indulging in <a href="org.htm">org</a>ies of proscriptions and de<a href="port.htm">port</a>ations, such as were seen<br/>
in France in 1815, 1848, and 1871.<br/>
<br/>
All is interdependent in a civilized society; it is impossible to reform<br/>
any one <a href="thing.htm">thing</a> without altering the whole. Therefore, on the day a nation<br/>
will strike at private <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty, under any one of its forms, territorial<br/>
or industrial, it will be obliged to attack them all. The very success<br/>
of the Revolution will impose it.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, even if it were desired, it would be impossible to confine the<br/>
<a href="chang.htm">chang</a>e to a partial expropriation. Once the principle of the "Divine<br/>
Right of <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty" is shaken, no amount of theorizing will prevent its<br/>
o<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>hrow, here by the slaves of the field, there by the slaves of the<br/>
machine.<br/>
<br/>
If a great town, Paris for example, were to confine itself to taking<br/>
possession of the dwelling houses of the <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies, it would be forced<br/>
also to deny the right of the bankers to levy upon the <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>e a <a href="tax.htm">tax</a><br/>
amounting to £2,000,000, in the form of <a href="interest.htm">interest</a> for former loans. The<br/>
great city would be obliged to put itself in touch with the rural<br/>
districts, and its influence would inevitably urge the peasants to <a href="free.htm">free</a><br/>
themselves from the <a href="land.htm">land</a><a href="own.htm">own</a>er. It would be necessary to <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>alize the<br/>
railways, that the citizens might get <a href="food.htm">food</a> and <a href="work.htm">work</a>, and lastly, to<br/>
prevent the waste of supplies; and to guard aga<a href="inst.htm">inst</a> the trusts of<br/>
corn-speculators, like those to whom the Paris <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>e of 1793 fell a<br/>
prey, it would have to place in the hands of the City the <a href="work.htm">work</a> of<br/>
stocking its warehouses with commodities, and ap<a href="port.htm">port</a>ioning the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
Some Socialists still seek, however, to establish a distinction. "Of<br/>
course," they say, "the soil, the mines, the mills, and manufacturers<br/>
<a href="must.htm">must</a> be expropriated, these are the <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ruments of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, and it is<br/>
right <a href="we.htm">we</a> should consider them public <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty. But articles of<br/>
<a href="consum.htm">consum</a>ption--<a href="food.htm">food</a>, <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>es, and dwellings--should remain private<br/>
<a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty."<br/>
<br/>
Popular <a href="common.htm">common</a> sense has got the better of this subtle distinction. <a href="we.htm">We</a><br/>
are not savages who can live in the woods, without other <a href="shelter.htm">shelter</a> than<br/>
the branches. The civilized man <a href="need.htm">need</a>s a roof, a room, a hearth, and a<br/>
bed. It is true that the bed, the room, and the house is a home of<br/>
idleness for the non-<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>er. But for the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er, a room, <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ly<br/>
heated and lighted, is as much an <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>rument of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion as the tool<br/>
or the machine. It is the place where the nerves and sinews <a href="gath.htm">gath</a>er<br/>
strength for the <a href="work.htm">work</a> of the morrow. The rest of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>man is the<br/>
daily repairing of the machine.<br/>
<br/>
The same argument applies even more obviously to <a href="food.htm">food</a>. The so-called<br/>
<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omists, who <a href="make.htm">make</a> the just-mentioned distinction, would hardly deny<br/>
that the coal burnt in a machine is as necessary to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion as the<br/>
raw <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ial itself. How then can <a href="food.htm">food</a>, without which the human machine<br/>
could do no <a href="work.htm">work</a>, be excluded from the list of <a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s indispensable to<br/>
the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>er? Can this be a relic of religious <a href="meta.htm">meta</a><a href="phys.htm">phys</a>ics? The rich<br/>
man's feast is indeed a <a href="matt.htm">matt</a>er of luxury, but the <a href="food.htm">food</a> of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er is<br/>
just as much a part of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion as the fuel burnt by the s<a href="team.htm">team</a>-engine.<br/>
<br/>
The same with <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>ing. <a href="we.htm">We</a> are not <a href="new.htm">New</a> Guinea savages. And if the dainty<br/>
gowns of <a href="our.htm">our</a> ladies <a href="must.htm">must</a> rank as <a href="object.htm">object</a>s of luxury, there is<br/>
ne<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>heless a certain quantity of linen, cotton, and woolen stuff which<br/>
is a necessity of life to the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>er. The shirt and tro<a href="user.htm">user</a>s in which<br/>
he goes to his <a href="work.htm">work</a>, the jacket he slips on after the day's toil is<br/>
over, are as necessary to him as the hammer to the anvil.<br/>
<br/>
Whether <a href="we.htm">we</a> like it or not, this is what the people mean by a revolution.<br/>
As soon as they have made a <a href="clean.htm">clean</a> sweep of the Government, they will<br/>
seek first of all to ensure to themselves decent dwellings and<br/>
sufficient <a href="food.htm">food</a> and <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>es--<a href="free.htm">free</a> of <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ist <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>.<br/>
<br/>
And the people will be right. The methods of the people will be much<br/>
more in accordance with science than those of the <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omists who draw so<br/>
many distinctions between <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ruments of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and articles of<br/>
<a href="consum.htm">consum</a>ption. The people understand that this is just the <a href="point.htm">point</a> where the<br/>
Revolution ought to begin; and they will lay the foundations of the only<br/>
<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic science <a href="worth.htm">worth</a>y the <a href="name.htm">name</a>--a science which might be called: "_The<br/>
Study of the <a href="need.htm">Need</a>s of Humanity, and of the <a href="econ.htm">Econ</a>omic <a href="means.htm">Means</a> to satisfy<br/>
them_."<br/>

CHAPTER V<br/>
<br/>
<a href="food.htm">FOOD</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I<br/>
<br/>
If the coming Revolution is to be a Social Revolution, it will be<br/>
distinguished from all former uprisings not only by its aim, but also by<br/>
its methods. To attain a <a href="new.htm">new</a> end, <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="means.htm">means</a> are required.<br/>
<br/>
The three great popular movements which <a href="we.htm">we</a> have seen in France during<br/>
the last hundred years differ from each other in many ways, but they<br/>
have one <a href="common.htm">common</a> feature.<br/>
<br/>
In each case the people strove to o<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>urn the <a href="old.htm">old</a> regime, and spent<br/>
their heart's blood for the cause. Then, after having borne the brunt of<br/>
the battle, they sank again into obscurity. A Government, composed of<br/>
men more or less honest, was formed and undertook to <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nize a <a href="new.htm">new</a><br/>
regime: the Republic in 1793, Labour in 1848, the <a href="free.htm">Free</a> <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>e in 1871.<br/>
Imbued with Jacobin ideas, this Government occupied itself first of all<br/>
with political questions, such as the re<a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization of the machinery of<br/>
government, the purifying of the administration, the separation of<br/>
Church and State, civic liberty, and such <a href="matt.htm">matt</a>ers. It is true the<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>men's clubs kept an eye on the members of the <a href="new.htm">new</a> Government, and<br/>
often imposed their ideas on them. But even in these clubs, whether the<br/>
leaders belonged to the middle or the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing <a href="class.htm">class</a>es, it was always<br/>
middle-<a href="class.htm">class</a> ideas which prevailed. They discussed various political<br/>
questions at great length, but forgot to discuss the question of <a href="bread.htm">bread</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Great ideas sprang up at such <a href="time.htm">time</a>s, ideas that have moved the world;<br/>
<a href="word.htm">word</a>s were spoken which still stir <a href="our.htm">our</a> hearts, at the interval of more<br/>
than a century. But the people were <a href="star.htm">star</a>ving in the slums.<br/>
<br/>
From the very Commencement of the Revolution industry inevitably came to<br/>
a stop--the circulation of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e was checked, and <a href="capital.htm">capital</a> concealed<br/>
itself. The master--the <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>er--had no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> to fear at such <a href="time.htm">time</a>s, he<br/>
fattened on his dividends, if indeed he did not specu<a href="late.htm">late</a> on the<br/>
wretchedness around; but the <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>-earner was reduced to live from hand<br/>
to mouth. <a href="want.htm">Want</a> knocked at the door.<br/>
<br/>
Famine was abroad in the <a href="land.htm">land</a>--such famine as had hardly been seen under<br/>
the <a href="old.htm">old</a> regime.<br/>
<br/>
"The Girondists are <a href="star.htm">star</a>ving <a href="us.htm">us</a>!" was the cry in the <a href="work.htm">work</a>men's quarters<br/>
in 1793, and thereupon the Girondists were guillotined, and full powers<br/>
were given to "the Mountain" and to the <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>e. The <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>e indeed<br/>
concerned itself with the question of <a href="bread.htm">bread</a>, and made heroic efforts to<br/>
feed Paris. At Lyons, Fouché and Collot d'Herbois established city<br/>
granaries, but the sums spent on filling them were woefully<br/>
insufficient. The town councils made great efforts to procure corn; the<br/>
bakers who hoarded flour were hanged--and still the people lacked <a href="bread.htm">bread</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Then they turned on the royalist conspirators and laid the blame at<br/>
their door. They guillotined a dozen or fifteen a day--<a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ants and<br/>
duchesses alike, especially <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ants, for the duchesses had gone to<br/>
Coblentz. But if they had guillotined a hundred dukes and viscounts<br/>
every day, it would have been equally hopeless.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="want.htm">want</a> only grew. For the <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>-earner cannot live without his <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>,<br/>
and the <a href="wage.htm">wage</a> was not forthcoming. What difference could a thousand<br/>
corpses more or less <a href="make.htm">make</a> to him?<br/>
<br/>
Then the people began to <a href="grow.htm">grow</a> weary. "So much for your vaunted<br/>
Revolution! You are more wretched than ever before," whispered the<br/>
reactionary in the ears of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er. And little by little the rich<br/>
took courage, emerged from their hiding-places, and flaunted their<br/>
luxury in the face of the <a href="star.htm">star</a>ving multitude. They dressed up like<br/>
scented fops and said to the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers: "Come, enough of this foolery!<br/>
What have you gained by your Revolution?"<br/>
<br/>
And, sick at heart, his patience at an end, the revolutionary had at<br/>
last to admit to himself that the cause was lost once more. He retreated<br/>
into his hovel and awaited the worst.<br/>
<br/>
Then reaction proudly asserted itself, and accomplished a<br/>
counter-revolutionary stroke. The Revolution dead, no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> remained but<br/>
to trample its corpse under foot.<br/>
<br/>
The White Terror began. Blood flowed like <a href="water.htm">water</a>, the guillotine was<br/>
never idle, the prisons were <a href="crowd.htm">crowd</a>ed, while the pageant of rank and<br/>
fashion <a href="resume.htm">resume</a>d its <a href="old.htm">old</a> course, and went on as merrily as before.<br/>
<br/>
This picture is typical of all <a href="our.htm">our</a> revolutions. In 1848 the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers of<br/>
Paris placed "three months of <a href="star.htm">star</a>vation" at the <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ice of the<br/>
Republic, and then, having reached the limit of their powers, they made,<br/>
in June, one last desperate effort--an effort which was drowned in<br/>
blood. In 1871 the <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>e perished for lack of combatants. It had taken<br/>
measures for the separation of Church and State, but it neglected, alas,<br/>
until too <a href="late.htm">late</a>, to take measures for providing the people with <a href="bread.htm">bread</a>.<br/>
And so it came to <a href="pass.htm">pass</a> in Paris that _élégantes_ and fine gentlemen<br/>
could spurn the confederates, and bid them go <a href="sell.htm">sell</a> their lives for a<br/>
miserable pittance, and leave their "betters" to feast at their ease in<br/>
fashionable restaurants.<br/>
<br/>
At last the <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>e saw its mistake, and <a href="open.htm">open</a>ed <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>al kitchens. But<br/>
it was too <a href="late.htm">late</a>. Its days were already numbered, and the troops of<br/>
Versailles were on the ramparts.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"<a href="bread.htm">Bread</a>, it is <a href="bread.htm">bread</a> that the Revolution <a href="need.htm">need</a>s!"<br/>
<br/>
Let others spend their <a href="time.htm">time</a> in issuing pompous proclamations, in<br/>
decorating themselves lavishly with official <a href="gold.htm">gold</a> lace, and in talking<br/>
about political liberty!...<br/>
<br/>
Be it <a href="our.htm">our</a>s to see, from the first day of the Revolution to the last, in<br/>
all the provinces fighting for <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom, that there is not a single man<br/>
who lacks <a href="bread.htm">bread</a>, not a single woman compelled to stand with the wearied<br/>
<a href="crowd.htm">crowd</a> outside the bakehouse-door, that haply a coarse loaf may be<br/>
thrown to her in charity, not a single child pining for <a href="want.htm">want</a> of <a href="food.htm">food</a>.<br/>
<br/>
It has always been the middle-<a href="class.htm">class</a> idea to harangue about "great<br/>
principles"--great lies rather!<br/>
<br/>
The idea of the people will be to provide <a href="bread.htm">bread</a> for all. And while<br/>
middle-<a href="class.htm">class</a> citizens, and <a href="work.htm">work</a>men infested with middle-<a href="class.htm">class</a> ideas<br/>
admire their <a href="own.htm">own</a> rhetoric in the "Talking Shops," and "practical people"<br/>
are engaged in endless discussions on forms of government, <a href="we.htm">we</a>, the<br/>
"Utopian dreamers"--<a href="we.htm">we</a> shall have to consider the question of daily<br/>
<a href="bread.htm">bread</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> have the temerity to declare that all have a right to <a href="bread.htm">bread</a>, that<br/>
there is <a href="bread.htm">bread</a> enough for all, and that with this watch<a href="word.htm">word</a> of _<a href="bread.htm">Bread</a><br/>
for All_ the Revolution will triumph.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
II<br/>
<br/>
That <a href="we.htm">we</a> are Utopians is well known. So Utopian are <a href="we.htm">we</a> that <a href="we.htm">we</a> go the<br/>
length of believing that the Revolution can and ought to <a href="assur.htm">assur</a>e <a href="shelter.htm">shelter</a>,<br/>
<a href="food.htm">food</a>, and <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>es to all--an idea extremely displeasing to middle-<a href="class.htm">class</a><br/>
citizens, whatever their party colour, for they are quite alive to the<br/>
fact that it is not easy to keep the upper hand of a people whose hunger<br/>
is satisfied.<br/>
<br/>
All the same, <a href="we.htm">we</a> maintain <a href="our.htm">our</a> contention: <a href="bread.htm">bread</a> <a href="must.htm">must</a> be found for the<br/>
people of the Revolution, and the question of <a href="bread.htm">bread</a> <a href="must.htm">must</a> take precedence<br/>
of all other questions. If it is settled in the <a href="interest.htm">interest</a>s of the people,<br/>
the Revolution will be on the right road; for in <a href="solv.htm">solv</a>ing the question of<br/>
<a href="bread.htm">Bread</a> <a href="we.htm">we</a> <a href="must.htm">must</a> accept the principle of equality, which will force itself<br/>
upon <a href="us.htm">us</a> to the exclusion of every other <a href="solu.htm">solu</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
It is certain that the coming Revolution--like in that respect to the<br/>
Revolution of 1848--will burst upon <a href="us.htm">us</a> in the middle of a great<br/>
industrial crisis. <a href="thing.htm">Thing</a>s have been see<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> for half a century now, and<br/>
can only go from bad to worse. Every<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> tends that way--<a href="new.htm">new</a> nations<br/>
entering the lists of international <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e and fighting for possession<br/>
of the world's markets, wars, <a href="tax.htm">tax</a>es ever increasing. National <a href="debt.htm">debt</a>s,<br/>
the in<a href="secur.htm">secur</a>ity of the morrow, and huge colonial undertakings in every<br/>
corner of the globe.<br/>
<br/>
There are millions of un<a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ed <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers in Europe at this moment. It<br/>
will be still worse when Revolution has burst upon <a href="us.htm">us</a> and spread like<br/>
fire laid to a train of gunpowder. The number of the out-of-<a href="work.htm">work</a>s will<br/>
be doubled as soon as the barricades are erected in Europe and the<br/>
United States. What is to be done to provide these multitudes with<br/>
<a href="bread.htm">bread</a>?<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> do not know whether the folk who call themselves "practical people"<br/>
have ever asked themselves this question in all its nakedness. But <a href="we.htm">we</a> do<br/>
know that they wish to maintain the <a href="wage.htm">wage</a> system, and <a href="we.htm">we</a> <a href="must.htm">must</a> therefore<br/>
expect to have "national <a href="work.htm">work</a>shops" and "public <a href="work.htm">work</a>s" vaunted as a<br/>
<a href="means.htm">means</a> of giving <a href="food.htm">food</a> to the un<a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ed.<br/>
<br/>
Because national <a href="work.htm">work</a>shops were <a href="open.htm">open</a>ed in 1789 and 1793; because the<br/>
same <a href="means.htm">means</a> were re<a href="sort.htm">sort</a>ed to in 1848; because Napoleon III. succeeded in<br/>
contenting the Parisian proletariat for eighteen years by giving them<br/>
public <a href="work.htm">work</a>s--which <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> Paris to-day its <a href="debt.htm">debt</a> of £80,000,000 and its<br/>
municipal <a href="tax.htm">tax</a> of three or four pounds a-head;<small>[3]</small> because this ex<a href="cell.htm">cell</a>ent<br/>
method of "taming the beast" was <a href="cust.htm">cust</a>omary in Rome, and even in Egypt<br/>
four thousand years ago; and lastly, because despots, kings, and<br/>
emperors have always <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ed the ruse of throwing a scrap of <a href="food.htm">food</a> to<br/>
the people to gain <a href="time.htm">time</a> to snatch up the whip--it is natural that<br/>
"practical" men should extol this method of perpetuating the <a href="wage.htm">wage</a><br/>
system. What <a href="need.htm">need</a> to rack <a href="our.htm">our</a> brains when <a href="we.htm">we</a> have the <a href="time.htm">time</a>-honoured<br/>
method of the Pharaohs at <a href="our.htm">our</a> disposal?<br/>
<br/>
Yet should the Revolution be so misguided as to <a href="star.htm">star</a>t on this path, it<br/>
would be lost.<br/>
<br/>
In 1848, when the national <a href="work.htm">work</a>shops were <a href="open.htm">open</a>ed on February 27, the<br/>
un<a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ed of Paris numbered only 8,000; a fortnight <a href="late.htm">late</a>r they had<br/>
already increased to 49,000. They would soon have been 100,000, without<br/>
counting those who <a href="crowd.htm">crowd</a>ed in from the provinces.<br/>
<br/>
Yet at that <a href="time.htm">time</a> <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e and manufacturers in France <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ed half as many<br/>
hands as to-day. And <a href="we.htm">we</a> know that in <a href="time.htm">time</a> of Revolution <a href="exch.htm">exch</a>ange and<br/>
industry suffer most from the general upheaval. <a href="we.htm">We</a> have only to think,<br/>
indeed, of the number of <a href="work.htm">work</a>men whose labour depends directly or<br/>
indirectly upon ex<a href="port.htm">port</a> <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e, or of the number of hands <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ed in<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing luxuries, whose <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>ers are the middle-<a href="class.htm">class</a> minority.<br/>
<br/>
A revolution in Europe <a href="means.htm">means</a>, then, the unavoidable stoppage of at least<br/>
half the <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies and <a href="work.htm">work</a>shops. It <a href="means.htm">means</a> millions of <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers and their<br/>
families thrown on the streets. And <a href="our.htm">our</a> "practical men" would seek to<br/>
a<a href="vert.htm">vert</a> this truly terrible situation by <a href="means.htm">means</a> of national relief <a href="work.htm">work</a>s;<br/>
that is to say, by <a href="means.htm">means</a> of <a href="new.htm">new</a> industries <a href="creat.htm">creat</a>ed on the spot to give<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a> to the un<a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ed!<br/>
<br/>
It is evident, as Proudhon had already <a href="point.htm">point</a>ed out more than fifty years<br/>
ago, that the smallest attack upon <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty will bring in its train the<br/>
complete dis<a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization of the system based upon private enterprise and<br/>
<a href="wage.htm">wage</a> labour. Society itself will be forced to take <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion in hand,<br/>
in its entirety, and to re<a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nize it to meet the <a href="need.htm">need</a>s of the whole<br/>
people. But this cannot be accomplished in a day, or even in a month; it<br/>
<a href="must.htm">must</a> take a certain <a href="time.htm">time</a> to re<a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nize the system of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, and<br/>
during this <a href="time.htm">time</a> millions of men will be deprived of the <a href="means.htm">means</a> of<br/>
subsistence. What then is to be done?<br/>
<br/>
There is only one really _practical_ <a href="solu.htm">solu</a>tion of the problem--boldly to<br/>
face the great task which awaits <a href="us.htm">us</a>, and <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ead of trying to patch up a<br/>
situation which <a href="we.htm">we</a> <a href="our.htm">our</a>selves have made untenable, to proceed to<br/>
re<a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nize <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion on a <a href="new.htm">new</a> basis.<br/>
<br/>
Thus the really practical course of <a href="act.htm">act</a>ion, in <a href="our.htm">our</a> view, would be that<br/>
the people should take im<a href="media.htm">media</a>te possession of all the <a href="food.htm">food</a> of the<br/>
<a href="insur.htm">insur</a>gent <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>es, keeping strict account of it all, that none might be<br/>
wasted, and that by the aid of these accumu<a href="late.htm">late</a>d re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es every one<br/>
might be able to tide over the crisis. During that <a href="time.htm">time</a> an <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment<br/>
would have to be made with the <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>y <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers, the necessary raw<br/>
<a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ial given them, and the <a href="means.htm">means</a> of subsistence <a href="assur.htm">assur</a>ed to them, while<br/>
they <a href="work.htm">work</a>ed to supply the <a href="need.htm">need</a>s of the <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>cultural population. For <a href="we.htm">we</a><br/>
<a href="must.htm">must</a> not forget that while France weaves silks and satins to deck the<br/>
wives of German financiers, the Empress of Russia, and the Queen of the<br/>
Sandwich Is<a href="land.htm">land</a>s, and while Paris fashions wonderful trinkets and<br/>
play<a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s for rich folk all the world over, two-thirds of the French<br/>
peasantry have not <a href="proper.htm">proper</a> lamps to give them light, or the implements<br/>
necessary for <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture. Lastly, un<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive <a href="land.htm">land</a>, of which<br/>
there is plenty, would have to be turned to the best advantage, poor<br/>
soils enriched, and rich soils, which yet, under the present system, do<br/>
not yield a quarter, no, nor a tenth of what they might <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e, would<br/>
be submitted to intensive culture, and tilled with as much care as a<br/>
market garden or a flower pot. It is impossible to imagine any other<br/>
practical <a href="solu.htm">solu</a>tion of the problem; and, whether <a href="we.htm">we</a> like it or not, sheer<br/>
force of circumstances will bring it to <a href="pass.htm">pass</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
III<br/>
<br/>
The most prominent characteristic of <a href="our.htm">our</a> present <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ism is _the <a href="wage.htm">wage</a><br/>
system_, which in brief amounts to this:--<br/>
<br/>
A man, or a <a href="group.htm">group</a> of men, possessing the necessary <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>, <a href="star.htm">star</a>ts some<br/>
industrial enterprise; he undertakes to supply the <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>y or <a href="work.htm">work</a>shops<br/>
with raw <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ial, to <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nize <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> the <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>es a fixed<br/>
<a href="wage.htm">wage</a>, and lastly, to pocket the <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a> <a href="valu.htm">valu</a>e or <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s, under pre<a href="text.htm">text</a><br/>
of recouping himself for managing the concern, for running the risks it<br/>
may involve, and for the fluctuations of <a href="price.htm">price</a> in the market <a href="valu.htm">valu</a>e of<br/>
the wares.<br/>
<br/>
To pre<a href="serv.htm">serv</a>e this system, those who now monopolize <a href="capital.htm">capital</a> would be ready<br/>
to <a href="make.htm">make</a> certain concessions; to <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e, for example, a part of the<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s with the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers, or rather to establish a "sliding scale,"<br/>
which would oblige them to raise <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>s when <a href="price.htm">price</a>s were high; in brief<br/>
they would consent to certain sacrifices on condition that they were<br/>
still allowed to direct industry and to take its first fruits.<br/>
<br/>
Collectivism, as <a href="we.htm">we</a> know, does not abolish the <a href="wage.htm">wage</a> system, though it<br/>
introduces considerable <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ifications into the existing order of <a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s.<br/>
It only substitutes the State, that is to say, some form of<br/>
Representative Government, national or local, for the individual<br/>
<a href="employ.htm">employ</a>er of labour. Under Collectivism it is the representatives of the<br/>
nation, or of the <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>e, and their deputies and officials who are to<br/>
have the <a href="control.htm">control</a> of industry. It is they who re<a href="serv.htm">serv</a>e to themselves the<br/>
right of <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ing the <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a> of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion--in the <a href="interest.htm">interest</a>s of all.<br/>
Moreover, Collectivism draws a very subtle but very far-reaching<br/>
distinction between the <a href="work.htm">work</a> of the labourer and of the man who has<br/>
learned a craft. Un<a href="skill.htm">skill</a>ed labour in the eyes of the collectivist is<br/>
_simple_ labour, while the <a href="work.htm">work</a> of the craftsman, the mechanic, the<br/>
engineer, the man of science, etc., is what Marx calls _complex_ labour,<br/>
and is entitled to a higher <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>. But labourers and craftsmen, weavers<br/>
and men of science, are all <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>-<a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ants of the State--"all officials,"<br/>
as was said <a href="late.htm">late</a>ly, to gild the pill.<br/>
<br/>
Well, then, the coming Revolution could render no greater <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ice to<br/>
humanity than by making the <a href="wage.htm">wage</a> system, in all its forms, an<br/>
impossibility, and by rendering <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ism, which is the negation of<br/>
<a href="wage.htm">wage</a>-slavery, the only possible <a href="solu.htm">solu</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
For even admitting that the Collectivist <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ification of the present<br/>
system is possible, if introduced gradually during a period of<br/>
prosperity and peace--though for my part I question its practicability<br/>
even under such conditions--it would become impossible in a period of<br/>
Revolution, when the <a href="need.htm">need</a> of feeding hungry millions would spring up<br/>
with the first call to arms. A political revolution can be accomplished<br/>
without shaking the foundations of industry, but a revolution where the<br/>
people lay hands upon <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty will inevitably paralyse <a href="exch.htm">exch</a>ange and<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion. The millions of public <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y flowing into the Treasury<br/>
would not suffice for <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>s to the millions of out-of-<a href="work.htm">work</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
This <a href="point.htm">point</a> cannot be too much insisted upon; the re<a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization of<br/>
industry on a <a href="new.htm">new</a> basis <small>(and <a href="we.htm">we</a> shall presently show how tremendous this<br/>
problem is)</small> cannot be accomplished in a few days; nor, on the other<br/>
hand, will the people submit to be half <a href="star.htm">star</a>ved for years in order to<br/>
oblige the theorists who up<a href="hold.htm">hold</a> the <a href="wage.htm">wage</a> system. To tide over the period<br/>
of stress they will demand what they have always demanded in such<br/>
cases--<a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ization of supplies--the giving of rations.<br/>
<br/>
It will be in vain to preach patience. The people will be patient no<br/>
longer, and if <a href="food.htm">food</a> is not forthcoming they will plunder the bakeries.<br/>
<br/>
Then, if the people are not strong enough to <a href="carry.htm">carry</a> all before them, they<br/>
will be shot down, to give Collectivism a fair field for experiment. To<br/>
this end "_order_" <a href="must.htm">must</a> be maintained at any <a href="price.htm">price</a>--order, discipline,<br/>
obedience! And as the <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ists will soon realize that when the people<br/>
are shot down by those who call themselves Revolutionists, the<br/>
Revolution itself will become hateful in the eyes of the masses, they<br/>
will certainly lend their sup<a href="port.htm">port</a> to the champions of _order_--even<br/>
though they are collectivists. In such a line of conduct, the<br/>
<a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ists will see a <a href="means.htm">means</a> of hereafter crushing the collectivists in<br/>
their turn. And if "order is established" in this fashion, the<br/>
consequences are easy to foresee. Not content with shooting down the<br/>
"marauders," the faction of "order" will search out the "ringleaders of<br/>
the mob." They will set up again the <a href="law.htm">law</a> courts and re<a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ate the<br/>
hangman. The most ardent revolutionists will be sent to the scaffold. It<br/>
will be 1793 over again.<br/>
<br/>
Do not let <a href="us.htm">us</a> forget how reaction triumphed in the last century. First<br/>
the "Hébertists" and "the madmen," were guillotined--those whom Mignet,<br/>
with the memory of the struggle fresh upon him, still called<br/>
"Anarchists." The Dantonists soon followed them; and when the party of<br/>
Robespierre had guillotined these revolutionaries, they in their turn<br/>
had to mount the scaffold; whereupon the people, sick of bloodshed, and<br/>
seeing the revolution lost, threw up the sponge, and let the<br/>
reactionaries do their worst.<br/>
<br/>
If "order is restored," <a href="we.htm">we</a> say, the social democrats will hang the<br/>
anarchists; the Fabians will hang the social democrats, and will in<br/>
their turn be hanged by the reactionaries; and the Revolution will come<br/>
to an end.<br/>
<br/>
But every<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> confirms <a href="us.htm">us</a> in the belief that the energy of the people<br/>
will <a href="carry.htm">carry</a> them far enough, and that, when the Revolution takes place,<br/>
the idea of anarchist <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ism will have gained ground. It is not an<br/>
artificial idea. The people themselves have breathed it in <a href="our.htm">our</a> ear, and<br/>
the number of <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ists is ever increasing, as the impossibility of any<br/>
other <a href="solu.htm">solu</a>tion becomes more and more evident.<br/>
<br/>
And if the impetus of the people is strong enough, affairs will take a<br/>
very diffe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> turn. <a href="inst.htm">Inst</a>ead of plundering the bakers' shops one day,<br/>
and <a href="star.htm">star</a>ving the next, the people of the <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>gent cities will take<br/>
possession of the warehouses, the cattle markets,--in fact of all the<br/>
provision stores and of all the <a href="food.htm">food</a> to be had. The well-intentioned<br/>
citizens, men and women <a href="bot.htm">bot</a>h, will form themselves into bands of<br/>
volunteers and address themselves to the task of making a rough general<br/>
inventory of the contents of each shop and warehouse.<br/>
<br/>
If such a revolution breaks out in France, <a href="name.htm">name</a>ly in Paris, then in<br/>
twenty-four hours the <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>e will know what Paris has not found out<br/>
yet, in spite of its statistical <a href="commit.htm">commit</a>tees, and what it never did find<br/>
out during the siege of 1871--the quantity of provisions it contains. In<br/>
forty-eight hours millions of <a href="copi.htm">copi</a>es will be <a href="print.htm">print</a>ed of the tables<br/>
giving a sufficiently exact account of the available <a href="food.htm">food</a>, the places<br/>
where it is stored, and the <a href="means.htm">means</a> of distribution.<br/>
<br/>
In every b<a href="lock.htm">lock</a> of houses, in every street, in every town ward, <a href="group.htm">group</a>s of<br/>
volunteers will have been <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nized, and these commissariat volunteers<br/>
will find it easy to <a href="work.htm">work</a> in unison and keep in touch with each other.<br/>
If only the Jacobin bayonets do not get in the way; if only the<br/>
self-styled "scientific" theorists do not thrust themselves in to<br/>
darken counsel! Or rather let them expound their muddle-headed theories<br/>
as much as they like, provided they have no authority, no power! And<br/>
that admirable spirit of <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization inhe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> in the people, above all<br/>
in every social grade of the French nation, but which they have so<br/>
seldom been allowed to exercise, will initiate, even in so huge a city<br/>
as Paris, and in the midst of a Revolution, an immense guild of <a href="free.htm">free</a><br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>ers, ready to furnish to each and all the necessary <a href="food.htm">food</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Give the people a <a href="free.htm">free</a> hand, and in ten days the <a href="food.htm">food</a> <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ice will be<br/>
conducted with admirable regularity. Only those who have never seen the<br/>
people hard at <a href="work.htm">work</a>, only those who have <a href="pass.htm">pass</a>ed their lives buried among<br/>
the documents, can doubt it. Speak of the <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nizing genius of the<br/>
"Great Misunderstood," the people, to those who have seen it in Paris in<br/>
the days of the barricades, or in London during the great dockers'<br/>
strike, when half a million of <a href="star.htm">star</a>ving folk had to be fed, and they<br/>
will tell you how superior it is to the official ineptness of Bumbledom.<br/>
<br/>
And even supposing <a href="we.htm">we</a> had to endure a certain amount of discomfort and<br/>
confusion for a fortnight or a month, surely that would not <a href="matt.htm">matt</a>er very<br/>
much. For the mass of the people it would still be an improvement on<br/>
their former condition; and, besides, in <a href="time.htm">time</a>s of Revolution one can<br/>
dine contentedly enough on a bit of <a href="bread.htm">bread</a> and cheese while eagerly<br/>
discussing events.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, a system which springs up spontaneously, under stress of<br/>
im<a href="media.htm">media</a>te <a href="need.htm">need</a>, will be infinitely preferable to any<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> invented<br/>
between four <a href="wall.htm">wall</a>s by hide-bound theorists sitting on any number of<br/>
<a href="commit.htm">commit</a>tees.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
IV<br/>
<br/>
The people of the great towns will be driven by force of circumstances<br/>
to take possession of all the provisions, beginning with the barest<br/>
necessaries, and gradually extending <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ism to other <a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s, in order<br/>
to satisfy the <a href="need.htm">need</a>s of all the citizens. The sooner it is done the<br/>
better; the sooner it is done the less misery there will be and the less<br/>
strife.<br/>
<br/>
But upon what basis <a href="must.htm">must</a> society be <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nized in order that all may have<br/>
their due <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e of <a href="food.htm">food</a> <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e? This is the question that meets <a href="us.htm">us</a> at<br/>
the outset.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> answer that there are no two ways of it. There is only one way in<br/>
which <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ism can be established equitably, only one way which<br/>
satisfies <a href="our.htm">our</a> <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>incts of justice and is at the same <a href="time.htm">time</a> practical;<br/>
<a href="name.htm">name</a>ly, the system already adopted by the agrarian <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>es of Europe.<br/>
<br/>
Take for example a peasant <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>e, no <a href="matt.htm">matt</a>er where, even in France,<br/>
where the Jacobins have done their best to destroy all <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>al usage.<br/>
If the <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>e possesses woods and copses, then, so long as there is<br/>
plenty of wood for all, every one can take as much as he <a href="want.htm">want</a>s, without<br/>
other let or hindrance than the public opinion of his neighbours. As to<br/>
the timber-trees, which are always <a href="scarc.htm">scarc</a>e, they have to be carefully<br/>
ap<a href="port.htm">port</a>ioned.<br/>
<br/>
The same with the <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>al <a href="past.htm">past</a>ure <a href="land.htm">land</a>; while there is enough and to<br/>
spare, no limit is put to what the cattle of each homestead may <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>e,<br/>
nor to the number of beasts grazing upon the <a href="past.htm">past</a>ures. Grazing grounds<br/>
are not divided, nor is fodder doled out, unless there is <a href="scarc.htm">scarc</a>ity. All<br/>
the Swiss <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>es, and scores of thousands in France and Germany,<br/>
wherever there is <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>al <a href="past.htm">past</a>ure <a href="land.htm">land</a>, practise this system.<br/>
<br/>
And in the countries of Eastern Europe, where there are great forests<br/>
and no <a href="scarc.htm">scarc</a>ity of <a href="land.htm">land</a>, you will find the peasants felling the trees as<br/>
they <a href="need.htm">need</a> them, and cultivating as much of the soil as they require,<br/>
without any thought of limiting each man's <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e of timber or of <a href="land.htm">land</a>.<br/>
But the timber will be allowanced, and the <a href="land.htm">land</a> par<a href="cell.htm">cell</a>ed out, to each<br/>
house<a href="hold.htm">hold</a> according to its <a href="need.htm">need</a>s, as soon as either becomes <a href="scarc.htm">scarc</a>e, as<br/>
is already the case in Russia.<br/>
<br/>
In a <a href="word.htm">word</a>, the system is this: no stint or limit to what the <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ity<br/>
possesses in <a href="abund.htm">abund</a>ance, but equal <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>ing and dividing of those<br/>
commodities which are <a href="scarc.htm">scarc</a>e or apt to run short. Of the 350 millions<br/>
who inhabit Europe, 200 millions still follow this system of natural<br/>
<a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ism.<br/>
<br/>
It is a fact <a href="worth.htm">worth</a> remarking that the same system prevails in the great<br/>
towns in the distribution of one commodity at least, which is found in<br/>
<a href="abund.htm">abund</a>ance, the <a href="water.htm">water</a> supplied to each house.<br/>
<br/>
As long as there is no fear of the supply running short, no <a href="water.htm">water</a><br/>
company thinks of checking the <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>ption of <a href="water.htm">water</a> in each house. Take<br/>
what you please! But during the great droughts, if there is any fear of<br/>
the supply failing, the <a href="water.htm">water</a> companies know that all they have to do is<br/>
to <a href="make.htm">make</a> known the fact, by <a href="means.htm">means</a> of a short ad<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>isement in the papers,<br/>
and the citizens will reduce their <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>ption of <a href="water.htm">water</a> and not let it<br/>
run to waste.<br/>
<br/>
But if <a href="water.htm">water</a> were <a href="act.htm">act</a>ually <a href="scarc.htm">scarc</a>e, what would be done? Recourse would be<br/>
had to a system of rations. Such a measure is so natural, so inhe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> in<br/>
<a href="common.htm">common</a> sense, that Paris twice asked to be put on rations during the two<br/>
sieges which it underwent in 1871.<br/>
<br/>
Is it necessary to go into details, to prepare tables, showing how the<br/>
distribution of rations may <a href="work.htm">work</a>, to prove that it is just and<br/>
equitable, infinitely more just and equitable than the existing state of<br/>
<a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s? All these tables and details will not <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>e to convince those of<br/>
the middle <a href="class.htm">class</a>es, nor, alas, those of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers tainted with<br/>
middle-<a href="class.htm">class</a> prejudices, who regard the people as a mob of savages ready<br/>
to fall upon and <a href="dev.htm">dev</a><a href="our.htm">our</a> each other, as soon as the Government ceases to<br/>
direct affairs. But those only who have never seen the people re<a href="solv.htm">solv</a>e<br/>
and <a href="act.htm">act</a> on their <a href="own.htm">own</a> initiative could doubt for a moment that if the<br/>
masses were masters of the situation, they would distribute rations to<br/>
each and all in strictest accordance with justice and equity.<br/>
<br/>
If you were to give utterance, in any <a href="gath.htm">gath</a>ering of people, to the<br/>
opinion that delicacies--<a href="game.htm">game</a> and such-like--should be re<a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ed for the<br/>
fastidious pa<a href="late.htm">late</a>s of aristocratic idlers, and black <a href="bread.htm">bread</a> given to the<br/>
sick in the hospitals, you would be hissed. But say at the same<br/>
<a href="gath.htm">gath</a>ering, preach at the street corners and in the market places, that<br/>
the most tempting delicacies ought to be kept for the sick and<br/>
feeble--especially for the sick. Say that if there are only five brace<br/>
of partridge in the entire city, and only one case of sherry, they<br/>
should go to sick people and convalescents. Say that after the sick come<br/>
the children. For them the milk of the cows and goats should be re<a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ed<br/>
if there is not enough for all. To the children and the aged the last<br/>
piece of meat, and to the strong man dry <a href="bread.htm">bread</a>, if the <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ity be<br/>
reduced to that extremity.<br/>
<br/>
Say, in a <a href="word.htm">word</a>, that if this or that article of <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>ption runs short,<br/>
and has to be doled out, to those who have most <a href="need.htm">need</a> most should be<br/>
given. Say that and see if you do not meet with universal <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment.<br/>
<br/>
The man who is full-fed does not understand this, but the people do<br/>
understand, and have always understood it; and even the child of luxury,<br/>
if he is thrown on the street and comes into contact with the masses,<br/>
even he will learn to understand.<br/>
<br/>
The theorists--for whom the <a href="sold.htm">sold</a>ier's uniform and the barrack mess table<br/>
are civilization's last <a href="word.htm">word</a>--would like no doubt to <a href="star.htm">star</a>t a regime of<br/>
National Kitchens and "Spartan Broth." They would <a href="point.htm">point</a> out the<br/>
advantages thereby gained, the <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy in fuel and <a href="food.htm">food</a>, if such huge<br/>
kitchens were established, where every one could come for their rations<br/>
of soup and <a href="bread.htm">bread</a> and vegetables.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> do not question these advantages. <a href="we.htm">We</a> are well aware that im<a href="port.htm">port</a>ant<br/>
<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omies have already been achieved in this direction--as, for<br/>
<a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ance, when the handmill, or quern, and the baker's oven attached to<br/>
each house were abandoned. <a href="we.htm">We</a> can see perfectly well that it would be<br/>
more <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omical to cook broth for a hundred families at once, <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ead of<br/>
lighting a hundred separate fires. <a href="we.htm">We</a> know, besides, that there are a<br/>
thousand ways of preparing potatoes, but that cooked in one huge pot for<br/>
a hundred families they would be just as <a href="good.htm">good</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> know, in fact, that variety in cooking being a <a href="matt.htm">matt</a>er of the<br/>
seasoning introduced by each cook or housewife, the cooking together of<br/>
a hundredweight of potatoes would not prevent each cook or housewife<br/>
from dressing and <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ing them in any way she pleased. And <a href="we.htm">we</a> know that<br/>
stock made from meat can be con<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>ed into a hundred diffe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> soups to<br/>
suit a hundred diffe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> tastes.<br/>
<br/>
But though <a href="we.htm">we</a> are quite aware of all these facts, <a href="we.htm">we</a> still maintain that<br/>
no one has a right to force a housewife to take her potatoes from the<br/>
<a href="commun.htm">commun</a>al kitchen ready cooked if she prefers to cook them herself in her<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a> pot on her <a href="own.htm">own</a> fire. And, above all, <a href="we.htm">we</a> should wish each one to be<br/>
<a href="free.htm">free</a> to take his meals with his family, or with his friends, or even in<br/>
a restaurant, if it seemed <a href="good.htm">good</a> to him.<br/>
<br/>
Naturally large public kitchens will spring up to take the place of the<br/>
restaurants, where people are poisoned nowadays. Already the Parisian<br/>
housewife gets the stock for her soup from the butcher, and <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>forms<br/>
it into whatever soup she likes, and London housekeepers know that they<br/>
can have a <a href="join.htm">join</a>t roasted, or an apple or rhubarb tart baked at the<br/>
baker's for a trifling sum, thus <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omizing <a href="time.htm">time</a> and fuel. And when the<br/>
<a href="commun.htm">commun</a>al kitchen--the <a href="common.htm">common</a> bakehouse of the <a href="future.htm">future</a>--is established,<br/>
and people can get their <a href="food.htm">food</a> cooked without the risk of being cheated<br/>
or poisoned, the <a href="cust.htm">cust</a>om will no doubt become general of going to the<br/>
<a href="commun.htm">commun</a>al kitchen for the fundamental parts of the meal, leaving the last<br/>
touches to be added as individual taste shall suggest.<br/>
<br/>
But to <a href="make.htm">make</a> a hard and fast rule of this, to <a href="make.htm">make</a> a duty of taking home<br/>
<a href="our.htm">our</a> <a href="food.htm">food</a> ready cooked, that would be as repugnant to <a href="our.htm">our</a> <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern minds as<br/>
the ideas of the convent or the barrack--morbid ideas born in brains<br/>
warped by tyranny or superstition.<br/>
<br/>
Who will have a right to the <a href="food.htm">food</a> of the <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>e? will <a href="assur.htm">assur</a>edly be the<br/>
first question which <a href="we.htm">we</a> shall have to ask <a href="our.htm">our</a>selves. Every township will<br/>
answer for itself, and <a href="we.htm">we</a> are convinced that the answers will all be<br/>
dictated by the sen<a href="time.htm">time</a>nt of justice. Until labour is re<a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nized, as<br/>
long as the disturbed period lasts, and while it is impossible to<br/>
distinguish between inveterate idlers and genuine <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers thrown out of<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>, the available <a href="food.htm">food</a> ought to be <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>ed by all without exception.<br/>
Those who have been enemies to the <a href="new.htm">new</a> order will hasten of their <a href="own.htm">own</a><br/>
accord to rid the <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>e of their presence. But it seems to <a href="us.htm">us</a> that the<br/>
masses of the people, which have always been magnanimous, and have<br/>
no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> of vindictiveness in their disposition, will be ready to <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e<br/>
their <a href="bread.htm">bread</a> with all who remain with them, conquered and conquerers<br/>
alike. It will be no loss to the Revolution to be inspired by such an<br/>
idea, and, when <a href="work.htm">work</a> is set agoing again, the antagonists of yesterday<br/>
will stand side by side in the same <a href="work.htm">work</a>shops. A society where <a href="work.htm">work</a> is<br/>
<a href="free.htm">free</a> will have no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> to fear from idlers.<br/>
<br/>
"But provisions will run short in a month!" <a href="our.htm">our</a> critics at once exclaim.<br/>
<br/>
"So much the better," say <a href="we.htm">we</a>. It will prove that for the first <a href="time.htm">time</a> on<br/>
record the people have had enough to <a href="eat.htm">eat</a>. As to the question of<br/>
obtaining fresh supplies, <a href="we.htm">we</a> shall discuss the <a href="means.htm">means</a> in <a href="our.htm">our</a> next<br/>
chapter.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
V<br/>
<br/>
By what <a href="means.htm">means</a> could a city in a state of revolution be supplied with<br/>
<a href="food.htm">food</a>? <a href="we.htm">We</a> shall answer this question, but it is obvious that the <a href="means.htm">means</a><br/>
re<a href="sort.htm">sort</a>ed to will depend on the character of the Revolution in the<br/>
provinces, and in neighbouring countries. If the entire nation, or,<br/>
better still, if all Europe should accomplish the Social Revolution<br/>
simultaneously, and <a href="star.htm">star</a>t with thorough-going <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ism, <a href="our.htm">our</a> procedure<br/>
would be simplified; but if only a few <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ities in Europe <a href="make.htm">make</a> the<br/>
attempt, other <a href="means.htm">means</a> will have to be chosen. The circumstances will<br/>
dictate the measures.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> are thus led, before <a href="we.htm">we</a> proceed further, to glance at the State of<br/>
Europe, and, without pretending to prophesy, <a href="we.htm">we</a> may try to foresee what<br/>
course the Revolution will take, or at least what will be its essential<br/>
features.<br/>
<br/>
Certainly it would be very desirable that all Europe should rise at<br/>
once, that expropriation should be general, and that <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>istic<br/>
principles should inspire all and <a href="sun.htm">sun</a>dry. Such a universal rising would<br/>
do much to simplify the task of <a href="our.htm">our</a> century.<br/>
<br/>
But all the signs lead <a href="us.htm">us</a> to believe that it will not take place. That<br/>
the Revolution will embrace Europe <a href="we.htm">we</a> do not doubt. If one of the four<br/>
great continental <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>s--Paris, Vienna, Brussels, or Berlin--rises in<br/>
revolution and o<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>urns its Government, it is almost certain that the<br/>
three others will follow its example within a few weeks' <a href="time.htm">time</a>. It is,<br/>
moreover, highly probable that the Peninsulas and even London and St.<br/>
Petersburg would not be long in following suit. But whether the<br/>
Revolution would everywhere exhibit the same characteristics is highly<br/>
doubtful.<br/>
<br/>
It is more than probable that expropriation will be everywhere carried<br/>
into effect on a larger scale, and that this policy carried out by any<br/>
one of the great nations of Europe will influence all the rest; yet the<br/>
beginnings of the Revolution will exhibit great local differences, and<br/>
its course will vary in diffe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> countries. In 1789-93, the French<br/>
peasantry took four years to finally rid themselves of the redemption of<br/>
feudal rights, and the bourgeois to o<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>hrow royalty. Let <a href="us.htm">us</a> keep that<br/>
in mind, and therefore be prepared to see the Revolution <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>elop itself<br/>
somewhat gradually. Let <a href="us.htm">us</a> not be disheartened if here and there its<br/>
steps should move less rapidly. Whether it would take an avowedly<br/>
socialist character in all European nations, at any rate at the<br/>
beginning, is doubtful. Germany, be it remembered, is still realizing<br/>
its dream of a United Empire. Its advanced parties see visions of a<br/>
Jacobin Republic like that of 1848, and of the <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization of labour<br/>
according to Louis Blanc; while the French people, on the other hand,<br/>
<a href="want.htm">want</a> above all <a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s a <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>e, whether it be a <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ist <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>e<br/>
or not.<br/>
<br/>
There is every reason to believe that, when the coming Revolution takes<br/>
place, Germany will go further than France went in 1793. The<br/>
eighteenth-century Revolution in France was an advance on the English<br/>
Revolution of the seventeenth, abolishing as it did at one stroke the<br/>
power of the throne and the <a href="land.htm">land</a>ed aristocracy, whose influence still<br/>
survives in Eng<a href="land.htm">land</a>. But, if Germany goes further and does greater<br/>
<a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s than France did in 1793, there can be no doubt that the ideas<br/>
which will foster the birth of her Revolution will be those of 1848;<br/>
while the ideas which will inspire the Revolution in Russia will<br/>
probably be a combination of those of 1789 with those of 1848.<br/>
<br/>
Without, however, attaching to these forecasts a greater im<a href="port.htm">port</a>ance than<br/>
they merit, <a href="we.htm">we</a> may safely conclude this much: the Revolution will take a<br/>
diffe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> character in each of the diffe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> European nations; the <a href="point.htm">point</a><br/>
attained in the socialization of wealth will not be everywhere the same.<br/>
<br/>
Will it therefore be necessary, as is some<a href="time.htm">time</a>s suggested, that the<br/>
nations in the vanguard of the movement should adapt their pace to those<br/>
who lag behind? <a href="must.htm">Must</a> <a href="we.htm">we</a> wait till the <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ist Revolution is ripe in<br/>
all civilized countries? Cl<a href="early.htm">early</a> not! Even if it were a <a href="thing.htm">thing</a> to be<br/>
desired, it is not possible. History does not wait for the laggards.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, <a href="we.htm">we</a> do not believe that in any one country the Revolution will<br/>
be accomplished at a stroke, in the twinkling of an eye, as some<br/>
socialists dream.<small>[4]</small> It is highly probable that if one of the five or<br/>
six large towns of France--Paris, Lyons, Marseilles, Lille,<br/>
Saint-Etienne, Bordeaux--were to proclaim the <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>e, the others would<br/>
follow its example, and that many smaller towns would do the same.<br/>
Probably also various mining districts and industrial centres would<br/>
hasten to rid themselves of "<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers" and "masters," and form themselves<br/>
into <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="group.htm">group</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
But many country places have not advanced to that <a href="point.htm">point</a>. Side by side<br/>
with the revolutionized <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>es such places would remain in an<br/>
expectant attitude, and would go on living on the Individualist system.<br/>
Undisturbed by visits of the bailiff or the <a href="tax.htm">tax</a>-collector, the peasants<br/>
would not be hostile to the revolutionaries, and thus, while <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>ing<br/>
by the <a href="new.htm">new</a> state of affairs, they would defer the settlement of accounts<br/>
with the local exploiters. But with that practical enthusiasm which<br/>
always characterizes agrarian uprisings <small>(witness the <a href="pass.htm">pass</a>ionate toil of<br/>
1792)</small> they would throw themselves into the task of cultivating the <a href="land.htm">land</a>,<br/>
which, <a href="free.htm">free</a>d from <a href="tax.htm">tax</a>es and mortgages, would become so much dearer to<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
As to other countries, revolution would break out everywhere, but<br/>
revolution under divers aspects; in one country State Socialism, in<br/>
another Federation; everywhere more or less Socialism, not conforming to<br/>
any particular rule.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
VI<br/>
<br/>
Let <a href="us.htm">us</a> now <a href="return.htm">return</a> to <a href="our.htm">our</a> city in revolt, and consider how its citizens<br/>
can provide <a href="food.htm">food</a>stuffs for themselves. How are the necessary provisions<br/>
to be obtained if the nation as a whole has not accepted <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ism? This<br/>
is the question to be <a href="solv.htm">solv</a>ed. Take, for example, one of the large French<br/>
towns--take the <a href="capital.htm">capital</a> itself, for that <a href="matt.htm">matt</a>er. Paris <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>es every<br/>
year thousands of tons of grain, 400,000 head of oxen, 300,000 calves,<br/>
400,000 swine, and more than two millions of sheep, besides great<br/>
quantities of <a href="game.htm">game</a>. This huge city <a href="dev.htm">dev</a><a href="our.htm">our</a>s, besides, more than 20<br/>
million pounds of butter, 200 million eggs, and other <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e in like<br/>
pro<a href="port.htm">port</a>ion.<br/>
<br/>
It im<a href="port.htm">port</a>s flour and grain from the United States and from Russia,<br/>
Hungary, Italy, Egypt, and the Indies; live stock from Germany, Italy,<br/>
Spain--even Roumania and Russia; and as for groceries, there is not a<br/>
country in the world that it does not lay under contribution.<br/>
<br/>
Now, let <a href="us.htm">us</a> see how Paris or any other great town could be revictualled<br/>
by home-<a href="grow.htm">grow</a>n <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e, supplies of which could be readily and willingly<br/>
sent in from the provinces.<br/>
<br/>
To those who put their trust in "authority" the question will appear<br/>
quite simple. They would begin by establishing a strongly centralized<br/>
Government, furnished with all the machinery of coercion--the police,<br/>
the army, the guillotine. This Government would draw up a statement of<br/>
all the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e contained in France. It would divide the country into<br/>
districts of supply, and then _command_ that a prescribed quantity of<br/>
some particular <a href="food.htm">food</a>stuff be sent to such a place on such a day, and<br/>
delivered at such a station, to be there received on a given day by a<br/>
specified official and stored in particular warehouses.<br/>
<br/>
Now, <a href="we.htm">we</a> declare with the fullest conviction, not merely that such a<br/>
<a href="solu.htm">solu</a>tion is undesirable, but that it never could by any possibility be<br/>
put into practice. It is wildly Utopian!<br/>
<br/>
Pen in hand, one may dream such a dream in the study, but in contact<br/>
with reality it comes to no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a>,--this was proved in 1793; for, like<br/>
all such theories, it leaves out of account the spirit of independence<br/>
that is in man. The attempt would lead to a universal uprising, to three<br/>
or four _Vendées_, to the villages rising aga<a href="inst.htm">inst</a> the towns, all the<br/>
country up in arms defying the city for its arrogance in attempting to<br/>
impose such a system upon the country.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> have already had too much of Jacobin Utopias! Let <a href="us.htm">us</a> see if some<br/>
other form of <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization will meet the case.<br/>
<br/>
During the great French Revolution, the provinces <a href="star.htm">star</a>ved the large<br/>
towns, and killed the Revolution. And yet it is a known fact that the<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion of grain in France during 1792-3 had not diminished; indeed,<br/>
the evidence goes to show that it had increased. But after having taken<br/>
possession of the manorial <a href="land.htm">land</a>s, after having reaped a har<a href="vest.htm">vest</a> from<br/>
them, the peasants would not part with their grain for paper-<a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y. They<br/>
withheld their <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e, waiting for a rise in the <a href="price.htm">price</a>, or the<br/>
introduction of <a href="gold.htm">gold</a>. The most rigorous measures of the National<br/>
Convention were without avail, and her executions failed to break up the<br/>
ring, or force the <a href="farm.htm">farm</a>ers to <a href="sell.htm">sell</a> their corn. For it is a <a href="matt.htm">matt</a>er of<br/>
history that the commissaries of the Convention did not scruple to<br/>
guillotine those who withheld their grain from the market, and<br/>
pitilessly executed those who specu<a href="late.htm">late</a>d in <a href="food.htm">food</a>stuffs. All the same,<br/>
the corn was not forthcoming, and the townsfolk suffered from famine.<br/>
<br/>
But what was offered to the husbandman in <a href="exch.htm">exch</a>ange for his hard toil?<br/>
_Assignats_, scraps of paper decreasing in <a href="valu.htm">valu</a>e every day, <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>es of<br/>
<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment, which could not be kept. A forty-pound <a href="note.htm">note</a> would not <a href="purch.htm">purch</a>ase<br/>
a pair of boots, and the peasant, very naturally, was not anxious to<br/>
barter a year's toil for a piece of paper with which he could not even<br/>
<a href="buy.htm">buy</a> a shirt.<br/>
<br/>
As long as <a href="worth.htm">worth</a>less paper-<a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y--whether called assignats or labour<br/>
<a href="note.htm">note</a>s--is offered to the peasant-<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>er it will always be the same.<br/>
The country will with<a href="hold.htm">hold</a> its <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e, and the towns will suffer <a href="want.htm">want</a>,<br/>
even if the recalcitrant peasants are guillotined as before.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> <a href="must.htm">must</a> offer to the peasant in <a href="exch.htm">exch</a>ange for his toil not <a href="worth.htm">worth</a>less<br/>
paper-<a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y, but the manufactured articles of which he stands in<br/>
im<a href="media.htm">media</a>te <a href="need.htm">need</a>. He lacks the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a> implements to till the <a href="land.htm">land</a>, <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>es<br/>
to <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> him from the inclemencies of the weather, lamps and oil to<br/>
replace his miserable rushlight or tallow dip, spades, rakes, ploughs.<br/>
All these <a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s, under present conditions, the peasant is forced to do<br/>
without, not because he does not feel the <a href="need.htm">need</a> of them, but because, in<br/>
his life of struggle and privation, a thousand <a href="use.htm">use</a>ful <a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s are beyond<br/>
his reach; because he has not <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y to <a href="buy.htm">buy</a> them.<br/>
<br/>
Let the town apply itself, without loss of <a href="time.htm">time</a>, to manufacturing all<br/>
that the peasant <a href="need.htm">need</a>s, <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ead of fashioning geegaws for the wives of<br/>
rich citizens. Let the sewing machines of Paris be set to <a href="work.htm">work</a> on<br/>
<a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>es for the country folk <a href="work.htm">work</a>aday <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>es and <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>es for <a href="sun.htm">Sun</a>day<br/>
too, <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ead of <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>ly evening dresses for the English and Russian<br/>
<a href="land.htm">land</a>lords and the African <a href="gold.htm">gold</a>-magnates' wives. Let the <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies and<br/>
foundries turn out <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>cultural implements, spades, rakes, and<br/>
such-like, <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ead of waiting till the English send them to France, in<br/>
<a href="exch.htm">exch</a>ange for French <a href="win.htm">win</a>es!<br/>
<br/>
Let the towns send no more inspectors to the villages, wearing red,<br/>
blue, or rainbow-coloured scarves, to convey to the peasant orders to<br/>
take his <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e to this place or that, but let them send friendly<br/>
embassies to the countryfolk and bid them in brotherly fashion: "Bring<br/>
<a href="us.htm">us</a> your <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e, and take from <a href="our.htm">our</a> stores and shops all the manufactured<br/>
articles you please."--Then provisions would pour in on every side. The<br/>
peasant would only with<a href="hold.htm">hold</a> what he <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed for his <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="use.htm">use</a>, and would<br/>
send the rest into the cities, feeling _for the first <a href="time.htm">time</a> in the course<br/>
of history_ that these toiling townsfolk were his comrades--his<br/>
brethren, and not his exploiters.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> shall be told, perhaps, that this would necessitate a complete<br/>
<a href="trans.htm">trans</a>formation of industry. Well, yes, that is true of certain<br/>
departments; but there are other branches which could be rapidly<br/>
<a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified in such a way as to furnish the peasant with <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>es, watches,<br/>
furniture, and the simple implements for which the towns <a href="make.htm">make</a> him <a href="pay.htm">pay</a><br/>
such exorbitant <a href="price.htm">price</a>s at the present <a href="time.htm">time</a>. Weavers, tailors,<br/>
shoe<a href="make.htm">make</a>rs, tinsmiths, cabinet-<a href="make.htm">make</a>rs, and many other <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>es and crafts<br/>
could easily direct their energies to the manufacture of <a href="use.htm">use</a>ful and<br/>
necessary articles, and abstain from <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing mere luxuries. All that<br/>
is <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed is that the public mind should be thoroughly convinced of the<br/>
necessity of this <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>formation, and should come to look upon it as an<br/>
<a href="act.htm">act</a> of justice and of progress, and that it should no longer allow<br/>
itself to be cheated by that dream, so dear to the theorists--the dream<br/>
of a revolution which confines itself to taking possession of the<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s of industry, and leaves <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and <a href="commer.htm">commer</a>ce just as they are<br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
This, then, is <a href="our.htm">our</a> view of the whole question. Cheat the peasant no<br/>
longer with scraps of paper--be the sums inscribed upon them ever so<br/>
large; but offer him in <a href="exch.htm">exch</a>ange for his <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e the very _<a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s_ of<br/>
which he, the tiller of the soil, stands in <a href="need.htm">need</a>. Then the fruits of the<br/>
<a href="land.htm">land</a> will be poured into the towns. If this is not done there will be<br/>
famine in <a href="our.htm">our</a> cities, and reaction and despair will follow in its train.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
VII<br/>
<br/>
All the great towns, <a href="we.htm">we</a> have said, <a href="buy.htm">buy</a> their grain, their flour, and<br/>
their meat, not only from the provinces, but also from abroad. Foreign<br/>
countries send Paris not only spices, <a href="fish.htm">fish</a>, and various dainties, but<br/>
also immense quantities of corn and meat.<br/>
<br/>
But when the Revolution comes these cities will have to depend on<br/>
foreign countries as little as possible. If Russian wheat, Italian or<br/>
Indian rice, and Spanish or Hungarian <a href="win.htm">win</a>es abound in the markets of<br/>
western Europe, it is not that the countries which ex<a href="port.htm">port</a> them have a<br/>
super<a href="abund.htm">abund</a>ance, or that such a <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e <a href="grow.htm">grow</a>s there of itself, like the<br/>
dandelion in the meadows. In Russia for <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ance, the peasant <a href="work.htm">work</a>s<br/>
sixteen hours a day, and half <a href="star.htm">star</a>ves from three to six months every<br/>
year, in order to ex<a href="port.htm">port</a> the grain with which he <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s the <a href="land.htm">land</a>lord and<br/>
the State. To-day the police appears in the Russian village as soon as<br/>
the har<a href="vest.htm">vest</a> is <a href="gath.htm">gath</a>ered in, and <a href="sell.htm">sell</a>s the peasant's last horse and last<br/>
cow for arrears of <a href="tax.htm">tax</a>es and <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> due to the <a href="land.htm">land</a>lord, unless the victim<br/>
immo<a href="late.htm">late</a>s himself of his <a href="own.htm">own</a> accord by <a href="sell.htm">sell</a>ing the grain to the<br/>
ex<a href="port.htm">port</a>ers. Usually, rather than part with his li<a href="vest.htm">vest</a>ock at a<br/>
disadvantage, he keeps only a nine-months' supply of grain, and <a href="sell.htm">sell</a>s<br/>
the rest. Then, in order to sustain life until the next har<a href="vest.htm">vest</a>, he<br/>
mixes birch-bark and tares with his flour for three months, if it has<br/>
been a <a href="good.htm">good</a> year, and for six months if it has been bad, while in London<br/>
they are <a href="eat.htm">eat</a>ing biscuits made of his wheat.<br/>
<br/>
But as soon as the Revolution comes, the Russian peasant will keep <a href="bread.htm">bread</a><br/>
enough for himself and his children; the Italian and Hungarian peasants<br/>
will do the same; the Hindoo, let <a href="us.htm">us</a> hope, will <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> by these <a href="good.htm">good</a><br/>
examples; and the <a href="farm.htm">farm</a>ers of America will hardly be able to cover all<br/>
the deficit in grain which Europe will experience. So it will not do to<br/>
count on their contributions of wheat and maize satisfying all the<br/>
<a href="want.htm">want</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
Since all <a href="our.htm">our</a> middle-<a href="class.htm">class</a> civilization is based on the exploitation of<br/>
inferior races and countries with less advanced industrial systems, the<br/>
Revolution will confer a boon at the very outset, by menacing that<br/>
"civilization," and allowing the so-called inferior races to <a href="free.htm">free</a><br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
But this great <a href="bene.htm">bene</a>fit will manifest itself by a steady and marked<br/>
diminution of the <a href="food.htm">food</a> supplies pouring into the great cities of western<br/>
Europe.<br/>
<br/>
It is difficult to predict the course of affairs in the provinces. On<br/>
the one hand the slave of the soil will take advantage of the Revolution<br/>
to straighten his bowed back. <a href="inst.htm">Inst</a>ead of <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing fourteen or fifteen<br/>
hours a day, as he does at present, he will be at liberty to <a href="work.htm">work</a> only<br/>
half that <a href="time.htm">time</a>, which of course would have the effect of decreasing the<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion of the principal articles of <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>ption--grain and meat.<br/>
<br/>
But, on the other hand, there will be an increase of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion as soon<br/>
as the peasant realizes that he is no longer forced to sup<a href="port.htm">port</a> the idle<br/>
rich by his toil. <a href="new.htm">New</a> tracts of <a href="land.htm">land</a> will be cleared, <a href="new.htm">new</a> and improved<br/>
machines set a-going.<br/>
<br/>
"Never was the <a href="land.htm">land</a> so energetically cultivated as in 1792, when the<br/>
peasant had taken back from the <a href="land.htm">land</a>lord the soil which he had coveted<br/>
so long," Michelet tells <a href="us.htm">us</a> speaking of the Great Revolution.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, before long, intensive culture would be within the reach of<br/>
all. Improved machinery, chemical manures, and all such <a href="matt.htm">matt</a>ers would<br/>
soon be supplied by the <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>e. But every<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> tends to indicate that<br/>
at the outset there would be a falling off in <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>cultural <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts, in<br/>
France and elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
In any case it would be wisest to count upon such a falling off of<br/>
contributions from the provinces as well as from abroad.--How is this<br/>
falling off to be made <a href="good.htm">good</a>?<br/>
<br/>
Why! by setting to <a href="work.htm">work</a> <a href="our.htm">our</a>selves! No <a href="need.htm">need</a> to rack <a href="our.htm">our</a> brains for<br/>
far-fetched panaceas when the remedy lies close at hand.<br/>
<br/>
The large towns, as well as the villages, <a href="must.htm">must</a> undertake to till the<br/>
soil. <a href="we.htm">We</a> <a href="must.htm">must</a> <a href="return.htm">return</a> to what biology calls "the integration of<br/>
functions"--after the division of labour, the taking up of it as a<br/>
whole--this is the course followed throughout Nature.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, philosophy apart, the force of circumstances would bring about<br/>
this result. Let Paris see that at the end of eight months it will be<br/>
running short of <a href="bread.htm">bread</a>, and Paris will set to <a href="work.htm">work</a> to <a href="grow.htm">grow</a> wheat.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="land.htm">Land</a> will not be <a href="want.htm">want</a>ing, for it is round the great towns, and round<br/>
Paris especially, that the parks and pleasure grounds of the <a href="land.htm">land</a>ed<br/>
gentry are to be found. These thousands of acres only await the <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>ed<br/>
labour of the husbandman to surround Paris with fields infinitely more<br/>
fertile and <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive than the steppes of southern Russia, where the<br/>
soil is dried up by the <a href="sun.htm">sun</a>. Nor will labour be lacking. To what should<br/>
the two million citizens of Paris turn their attention, when they would<br/>
be no longer catering for the luxurious fads and amusements of Russian<br/>
princes, Roumanian grandees, and wives of Berlin financiers?<br/>
<br/>
With all the mechanical inventions of the century; with all the<br/>
intelligence and technical <a href="skill.htm">skill</a> of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er ac<a href="cust.htm">cust</a>omed to deal with<br/>
complicated machinery; with inventors, chemists, professors of <a href="bot.htm">bot</a>any,<br/>
practical <a href="bot.htm">bot</a>anists like the market gardeners of Gennevilliers; with all<br/>
the <a href="plant.htm">plant</a> that they could <a href="use.htm">use</a> for multiplying and improving machinery;<br/>
and, finally, with the <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nizing spirit of the Parisian people, their<br/>
pluck and energy--with all these at its command, the <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture of the<br/>
anarchist <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>e of Paris would be a very diffe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> <a href="thing.htm">thing</a> from the rude<br/>
husbandry of the Ardennes.<br/>
<br/>
S<a href="team.htm">team</a>, electricity, the heat of the <a href="sun.htm">sun</a>, and the breath of the <a href="win.htm">win</a>d,<br/>
will ere long be pressed into <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ice. The s<a href="team.htm">team</a> plough and the s<a href="team.htm">team</a><br/>
harrow will quickly do the rough <a href="work.htm">work</a> of preparation, and the soil, thus<br/>
<a href="clean.htm">clean</a>ed and enriched, will only <a href="need.htm">need</a> the intelligent care of man, and of<br/>
woman even more than man, to be <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>ed with luxuriant vegetation--not<br/>
once but three or four <a href="time.htm">time</a>s in the year.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, learning the art of horticulture from experts, and trying<br/>
experiments in diffe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> methods on small patches of soil re<a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ed for<br/>
the purpose, vying with each other to obtain the best <a href="return.htm">return</a>s, finding<br/>
in <a href="phys.htm">phys</a>ical exercise, without exhaustion or over<a href="work.htm">work</a>, the <a href="heal.htm">heal</a>th and<br/>
strength which so often flags in cities,--men, women and children will<br/>
gladly turn to the labour of the fields, when it is no longer a slavish<br/>
drudgery, but has become a pleasure, a festival, a renewal of <a href="heal.htm">heal</a>th and<br/>
joy.<br/>
<br/>
"There are no barren <a href="land.htm">land</a>s; the earth is <a href="worth.htm">worth</a> what man is <a href="worth.htm">worth</a>"--that<br/>
is the last <a href="word.htm">word</a> of <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture. Ask of the earth, and she will<br/>
give you <a href="bread.htm">bread</a>, provided that you ask aright.<br/>
<br/>
A district, though it were as small as the two departments of the Seine<br/>
and the Seine-et-Oise, and with so great a city as Paris to feed, would<br/>
be practically sufficient to <a href="grow.htm">grow</a> upon it all the <a href="food.htm">food</a> supplies, which<br/>
otherwise might fail to reach it.<br/>
<br/>
The combination of <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture and industry, the husbandman and the<br/>
mechanic in the same individual--this is what anarchist <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ism will<br/>
inevitably lead <a href="us.htm">us</a> to, if it <a href="star.htm">star</a>ts fair with expropriation.<br/>
<br/>
Let the Revolution only get so far, and famine is not the enemy it will<br/>
have to fear. No, the danger which will menace it lies in timidity,<br/>
prejudice, and half-measures. The danger is where Danton saw it when he<br/>
cried to France: "De l'audace, de l'audace, et encore de l'audace." The<br/>
bold thought first, and the bold deed will not fail to follow.<br/>

as a "Constitution," but it had no representative Government. The<br/>
Ministry imposed upon the nation, up till 1870, the budget it chose to<br/>

CHAPTER VI<br/>
<br/>
DWELLINGS<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I<br/>
<br/>
Those who have closely watched the <a href="grow.htm">grow</a>th of Socialist ideas among the<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>ers <a href="must.htm">must</a> have noticed that on one momentous question--the housing of<br/>
the people--a definite conclusion is being imperceptibly arrived at. It<br/>
is a fact that in the large towns of France, and in many of the smaller<br/>
ones, the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers are coming gradually to the conclusion that<br/>
dwelling-houses are in no sense the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty of those whom the State<br/>
recognizes as their <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
This idea has evolved naturally in the minds of the people, and no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a><br/>
will ever convince them again that the "rights of <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty" ought to<br/>
extend to houses.<br/>
<br/>
The house was not built by its <a href="own.htm">own</a>er. It was erected, decorated and<br/>
furnished by innumerable <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers in the timber yard, the brick field,<br/>
and the <a href="work.htm">work</a>shop, toiling for dear life at a minimum <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y spent by the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er was not the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t of his <a href="own.htm">own</a> toil. It was<br/>
amassed, like all other riches, by <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers two-thirds or only<br/>
a half of what was their due.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover--and it is here that the enormity of the whole proceeding<br/>
becomes most glaring--the house owes its <a href="act.htm">act</a>ual <a href="valu.htm">valu</a>e to the <a href="profit.htm">profit</a><br/>
which the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er can <a href="make.htm">make</a> out of it. Now, this <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> results from the<br/>
fact that his house is built in a town--that is, in an agglomeration of<br/>
thousands of other houses, possessing paved streets, bridges, quays, and<br/>
fine public buildings, well lighted, and affording to its inhabitants a<br/>
thousand comforts and conveniences unknown in villages; a town in<br/>
regular <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ication with other towns, and itself a centre of<br/>
industry, <a href="commer.htm">commer</a>ce, science, and art; a town which the <a href="work.htm">work</a> of twenty or<br/>
thirty generations has made habitable, <a href="heal.htm">heal</a>thy, and beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
A house in certain parts of Paris is <a href="valu.htm">valu</a>ed at many thousands of pounds<br/>
sterling, not because thousands of pounds' <a href="worth.htm">worth</a> of labour have been<br/>
expended on that particular house, but because it is in Paris; because<br/>
for centuries <a href="work.htm">work</a>men, artists, thinkers, and men of learning and<br/>
letters have contributed to <a href="make.htm">make</a> Paris what it is to-day--a centre of<br/>
industry, <a href="commer.htm">commer</a>ce, politics, art, and science; because Paris has a<br/>
<a href="past.htm">past</a>; because, thanks to literature, the <a href="name.htm">name</a>s of its streets are<br/>
house<a href="hold.htm">hold</a> <a href="word.htm">word</a>s in foreign countries as well as at home; because it is<br/>
the fruit of eighteen centuries of toil, the <a href="work.htm">work</a> of fifty generations<br/>
of the whole French nation.<br/>
<br/>
Who, then, can appropriate to himself the tiniest plot of ground, or the<br/>
meanest building in such a city, without <a href="commit.htm">commit</a>ting a flagrant<br/>
injustice? Who, then, has the right to <a href="sell.htm">sell</a> to any bidder the smallest<br/>
<a href="port.htm">port</a>ion of the <a href="common.htm">common</a> heritage?<br/>
<br/>
On that <a href="point.htm">point</a>, as <a href="we.htm">we</a> have said, the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers begin to be <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>d. The idea<br/>
of <a href="free.htm">free</a> dwellings showed its existence very plainly during the siege of<br/>
Paris, when the cry was for an abatement pure and simple of the <a href="term.htm">term</a>s<br/>
demanded by the <a href="land.htm">land</a>lords. It appeared again during the <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>e of 1871,<br/>
when the Paris <a href="work.htm">work</a>men expected the Council of the <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>e to decide<br/>
boldly on the abolition of <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>. And when the <a href="new.htm">New</a> Revolution comes, it<br/>
will be the first question with which the poor will concern themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Whether in <a href="time.htm">time</a> of revolution or in <a href="time.htm">time</a> of peace, the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er <a href="must.htm">must</a> be<br/>
housed somehow or other; he <a href="must.htm">must</a> have some <a href="sort.htm">sort</a> of roof over his head.<br/>
But, however tumble-down and squalid his dwelling may be, there is<br/>
always a <a href="land.htm">land</a>lord who can evict him. True, during the Revolution the<br/>
<a href="land.htm">land</a>lord cannot find bailiffs and police-sergeants to throw the<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>man's rags and <a href="chat.htm">chat</a>tels into the street, but who knows what the <a href="new.htm">new</a><br/>
Government will do to-morrow? Who can say that it will not call coercion<br/>
to its aid again, and set the police <a href="pack.htm">pack</a> upon the tenant to hound him<br/>
out of his hovels? Have <a href="we.htm">we</a> not seen the <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>e of Paris proclaim the<br/>
remission of <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>s due up to the first of April only!<small>[5]</small> After that,<br/>
<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> had to be <a href="paid.htm">paid</a>, though Paris was in a state of chaos, and industry<br/>
at a standstill; so that the "federate" who had taken arms to defend the<br/>
independence of Paris had ab<a href="solu.htm">solu</a>tely no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> to depend upon--he and his<br/>
family--but an allowance of fifteen pence a day!<br/>
<br/>
Now the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er <a href="must.htm">must</a> be made to see cl<a href="early.htm">early</a> that in refusing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="rent.htm">rent</a><br/>
to a <a href="land.htm">land</a>lord or <a href="own.htm">own</a>er he is not simply <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>ing by the dis<a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization<br/>
of authority. He <a href="must.htm">must</a> understand that the abolition of <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> is a<br/>
recognized principle, sanctioned, so to speak, by popular assent; that<br/>
to be housed <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>-<a href="free.htm">free</a> is a right proclaimed aloud by the people.<br/>
<br/>
Are <a href="we.htm">we</a> going to wait till this measure, which is in harmony with every<br/>
honest man's sense of justice, is taken up by the few socialists<br/>
scattered among the middle <a href="class.htm">class</a> elements, of which the Provisionary<br/>
Government will be composed? If it were so, the people should have to<br/>
wait long--till the <a href="return.htm">return</a> of reaction, in fact!<br/>
<br/>
This is why, refusing uniforms and badges--those outward signs of<br/>
authority and <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>itude--and remaining people among the people, the<br/>
earnest revolutionists will <a href="work.htm">work</a> side by side with the masses, that the<br/>
abolition of <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>, the expropriation of houses, may become an<br/>
accomplished fact. They will prepare the ground and encourage ideas to<br/>
<a href="grow.htm">grow</a> in this direction; and when the fruit of their labours is ripe, the<br/>
people will proceed to expropriate the houses without giving heed to the<br/>
theories which will certainly be thrust in their way--theories about<br/>
<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing compensation to <a href="land.htm">land</a>lords, and finding first the necessary funds.<br/>
<br/>
On the day that the expropriation of houses takes place, on that day,<br/>
the exploited <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers will have realized that <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="time.htm">time</a>s have come, that<br/>
Labour will no longer have to bear the yoke of the rich and powerful,<br/>
that Equality has been <a href="open.htm">open</a>ly proclaimed, that this Revolution is a<br/>
real fact, and not a theatrical <a href="make.htm">make</a>-believe, like so many others<br/>
preceding it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
II<br/>
<br/>
If the idea of expropriation be adopted by the people it will be carried<br/>
into effect in spite of all the "<a href="insur.htm">insur</a>mountable" obstacles with which <a href="we.htm">we</a><br/>
are menaced.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the <a href="good.htm">good</a> folk in <a href="new.htm">new</a> uniforms, seated in the official<br/>
arm-chairs of the Hôtel de Ville, will be sure to busy themselves in<br/>
heaping up obstacles. They will talk of giving compensation to the<br/>
<a href="land.htm">land</a>lords, of preparing statistics, and drawing up long re<a href="port.htm">port</a>s. Yes,<br/>
they would be capable of drawing up re<a href="port.htm">port</a>s long enough to outlast the<br/>
hopes of the people, who, after waiting and <a href="star.htm">star</a>ving in enforced<br/>
idleness, and seeing no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> come of all these official researches,<br/>
would lose heart and faith in the Revolution and abandon the field to<br/>
the reactionaries. The <a href="new.htm">new</a> bureaucracy would end by making expropriation<br/>
hateful in the eyes of all.<br/>
<br/>
Here, indeed, is a rock which might shipwreck <a href="our.htm">our</a> hopes. But if the<br/>
people turn a deaf ear to the specious arguments <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to dazzle them,<br/>
and realize that <a href="new.htm">new</a> life <a href="need.htm">need</a>s <a href="new.htm">new</a> conditions, and if they undertake<br/>
the task themselves, then expropriation can be effected without any<br/>
great difficulty.<br/>
<br/>
"But how? How can it be done?" you ask <a href="us.htm">us</a>. <a href="we.htm">We</a> shall try to reply to this<br/>
question, but with a re<a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ation. <a href="we.htm">We</a> have no intention of tracing out<br/>
the <a href="plan.htm">plan</a>s of expropriation in their smallest details. <a href="we.htm">We</a> know beforehand<br/>
that all that any man, or <a href="group.htm">group</a> of men, could suggest to-day would be<br/>
far sur<a href="pass.htm">pass</a>ed by the reality when it comes. Man will accomplish greater<br/>
<a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s, and accomplish them better and by simpler methods than those<br/>
dictated to him beforehand. Thus <a href="we.htm">we</a> shall merely indicate the manner by<br/>
which expropriation _might_ be accomplished without the intervention of<br/>
Government. <a href="we.htm">We</a> do not propose to go out of <a href="our.htm">our</a> way to answer those who<br/>
declare that the <a href="thing.htm">thing</a> is impossible. <a href="we.htm">We</a> confine <a href="our.htm">our</a>selves to replying<br/>
that <a href="we.htm">we</a> are not the up<a href="hold.htm">hold</a>ers of any particular method of <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization.<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> are only concerned to demonstrate that expropriation _could_ be<br/>
effected by popular initiative, and _could not_ be effected by any other<br/>
<a href="means.htm">means</a> whatever.<br/>
<br/>
It seems very likely that, as soon as expropriation is fairly <a href="star.htm">star</a>ted,<br/>
<a href="group.htm">group</a>s of volunteers will spring up in every district, street, and b<a href="lock.htm">lock</a><br/>
of houses, and undertake to inquire into the number of flats and houses<br/>
which are empty and of those which are over<a href="crowd.htm">crowd</a>ed, the unwholesome<br/>
slums, and the houses which are too spacious for their occupants and<br/>
might well be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to house those who are stifled in swarming tenements.<br/>
In a few days these volunteers would have drawn up complete lists for<br/>
the street and the district of all the flats, tenements, family mansions<br/>
and villa residences, all the rooms and suites of rooms, <a href="heal.htm">heal</a>thy and<br/>
un<a href="heal.htm">heal</a>thy, small and large, foetid dens and homes of luxury.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="free.htm">Free</a>ly <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>icating with each other, these volunteers would soon have<br/>
their statistics complete. False statistics can be manufactured in board<br/>
rooms and offices, but true and exact statistics <a href="must.htm">must</a> begin with the<br/>
individual and mount up from the simple to the complex.<br/>
<br/>
Then, without waiting for anyone's leave, those citizens will probably<br/>
go and find their comrades who were living in miserable garrets and<br/>
hovels and will say to them simply: "It is a real Revolution this <a href="time.htm">time</a>,<br/>
comrades, and no mistake about it. Come to such a place this evening;<br/>
all the neighbourhood will be there; <a href="we.htm">we</a> are going to redistribute the<br/>
dwelling-houses. If you are tired of your slum-garret, come and choose<br/>
one of the flats of five rooms that are to be disposed of, and when you<br/>
have once moved in you shall stay, never fear. The people are up in<br/>
arms, and he who would venture to evict you will have to answer to<br/>
them."<br/>
<br/>
"But every one will <a href="want.htm">want</a> a fine house or a spacious flat!" <a href="we.htm">we</a> are<br/>
told.--No, you are quite mistaken. It is not the people's way to clamour<br/>
for the moon. On the contrary, every <a href="time.htm">time</a> <a href="we.htm">we</a> have seen them set about<br/>
repairing a wrong <a href="we.htm">we</a> have been struck by the <a href="good.htm">good</a> sense and <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>inct for<br/>
justice which animates the masses. Have <a href="we.htm">we</a> ever known them demand the<br/>
impossible? Have <a href="we.htm">we</a> ever seen the people of Paris fighting among<br/>
themselves while waiting for their rations of <a href="bread.htm">bread</a> or firewood during<br/>
the two sieges or during the terrible years of 1792-1794? The patience<br/>
and resignation which prevailed among them in 1871 was constantly<br/>
presented for admiration by the foreign Press correspondents; and yet<br/>
these patient waiters knew full well that the last comers would have to<br/>
<a href="pass.htm">pass</a> the day without <a href="food.htm">food</a> or fire.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> do not deny that there are plenty of egotistic <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>incts in iso<a href="late.htm">late</a>d<br/>
individuals. <a href="we.htm">We</a> are quite aware of it. But <a href="we.htm">we</a> contend that the very way<br/>
to revive and nourish these <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>incts would be to confine such questions<br/>
as the housing of the people to any board or <a href="commit.htm">commit</a>tee, in fact, to the<br/>
tender mercies of officialism in any shape or form. Then indeed all the<br/>
evil <a href="pass.htm">pass</a>ions spring up, and it becomes a case of who is the most<br/>
influential <a href="person.htm">person</a> on the board. The least inequality causes wranglings<br/>
and recriminations. If the smallest advantage is given to any one, a<br/>
tremendous hue and cry is raised--and not without reason.<br/>
<br/>
But if the people themselves, <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nized by streets, districts, and<br/>
parishes, undertake to move the inhabitants of the slums into the<br/>
half-empty dwellings of the middle <a href="class.htm">class</a>es, the trifling inconveniences,<br/>
the little inequalities will be easily tided over. Rarely has appeal<br/>
been made to the <a href="good.htm">good</a> <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>incts of the masses--only as a last re<a href="sort.htm">sort</a>, to<br/>
save the sinking ship in <a href="time.htm">time</a>s of revolution--but never has such an<br/>
appeal been made in vain; the heroism, the self-<a href="dev.htm">dev</a>otion of the toiler<br/>
has never failed to respond to it. And thus it will be in the coming<br/>
Revolution.<br/>
<br/>
But, when all is said and done, some inequalities, some inevitable<br/>
injustices, undoubtedly will remain. There are individuals in <a href="our.htm">our</a><br/>
societies whom no great crisis can lift out of the deep mire of egoism<br/>
in which they are <a href="sun.htm">sun</a>k. The question, however, is not whether there will<br/>
be injustices or no, but rather how to limit the number of them.<br/>
<br/>
Now all history, all the experience of the human race, and all social<br/>
psychology, unite in showing that the best and fairest way is to trust<br/>
the decision to those whom it concerns most n<a href="early.htm">early</a>. It is they alone who<br/>
can consider and allow for the hundred and one details which <a href="must.htm">must</a><br/>
necessarily be overlooked in any merely official redistribution.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
III<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, it is by no <a href="means.htm">means</a> necessary to <a href="make.htm">make</a> straightway an ab<a href="solu.htm">solu</a>tely<br/>
equal redistribution of all the dwellings. There will no doubt be some<br/>
inconveniences at first, but <a href="matt.htm">matt</a>ers will soon be righted in a society<br/>
which has adopted expropriation.<br/>
<br/>
When the masons, and carpenters, and all who are concerned in house<br/>
building, know that their daily <a href="bread.htm">bread</a> is <a href="secur.htm">secur</a>ed to them, they will ask<br/>
no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> better than to <a href="work.htm">work</a> at their <a href="old.htm">old</a> <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>es a few hours a day. They<br/>
will adapt the fine houses, which absorbed the <a href="time.htm">time</a> of a whole staff of<br/>
<a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ants, for giving <a href="shelter.htm">shelter</a> to several families, and in a few months<br/>
homes will have sprung up, infinitely <a href="heal.htm">heal</a>thier and more conveniently<br/>
arranged than those of to-day. And to those who are not yet comfortably<br/>
housed the anarchist <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>e will be able to say: "Patience, comrades!<br/>
Palaces fairer and finer than any the <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ists built for themselves<br/>
will spring from the ground of <a href="our.htm">our</a> enfranchised city. They will belong<br/>
to those who have most <a href="need.htm">need</a> of them. The anarchist <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>e does not<br/>
build with an eye to revenues. These monuments erected to its citizens,<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts of the collective spirit, will <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>e as <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>els to all humanity;<br/>
they will be yours."<br/>
<br/>
If the people of the Revolution expropriate the houses and proclaim <a href="free.htm">free</a><br/>
lodgings--the <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>alizing of houses and the right of each family to a<br/>
decent dwelling--then the Revolution will have assumed a <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>istic<br/>
character from the first, and <a href="star.htm">star</a>ted on a course from which it will be<br/>
by no <a href="means.htm">means</a> easy to turn it. It will have struck a fatal blow at<br/>
individual <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty.<br/>
<br/>
For the expropriation of dwellings contains in germ the whole social<br/>
revolution. On the manner of its accomplishment depends the character of<br/>
all that follows. Either <a href="we.htm">we</a> shall <a href="star.htm">star</a>t on a <a href="good.htm">good</a> road leading straight<br/>
to anarchist <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ism, or <a href="we.htm">we</a> shall remain sticking in the mud of<br/>
despotic individualism.<br/>
<br/>
It is easy to see the numerous <a href="object.htm">object</a>ions--theoretic on the one hand,<br/>
practical on the other--with which <a href="we.htm">we</a> are sure to be met. As it will be<br/>
a question of maintaining iniquity at any <a href="price.htm">price</a>, <a href="our.htm">our</a> opponents will of<br/>
course protest "in the <a href="name.htm">name</a> of justice." "Is it not a crying shame,"<br/>
they will exclaim, "that the people of Paris should take possession of<br/>
all these fine houses, while the peasants in the country have only<br/>
tumble-down huts to live in?" But do not let <a href="us.htm">us</a> <a href="make.htm">make</a> a mistake. These<br/>
enthusiasts for justice forget, by a lapse of memory to which they are<br/>
subject, the "crying shame" which they themselves are tacitly defending.<br/>
They forget that in this same city the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er, with his wife and<br/>
children, suffocates in a noisome garret, while from his <a href="window.htm">window</a> he sees<br/>
the rich man's palace. They forget that whole generations perish in<br/>
<a href="crowd.htm">crowd</a>ed slums, <a href="star.htm">star</a>ving for air and <a href="sun.htm">sun</a>light, and that to redress this<br/>
injustice ought to be the first task of the Revolution.<br/>
<br/>
Do not let these disingenuous protests <a href="hold.htm">hold</a> <a href="us.htm">us</a> back. <a href="we.htm">We</a> know that any<br/>
inequality which may exist between town and country in the <a href="early.htm">early</a> days of<br/>
the Revolution will be <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>itory and of a nature that will right itself<br/>
from day to day; for the village will not fail to improve its dwellings<br/>
as soon as the peasant has ceased to be the beast of burden of the<br/>
<a href="farm.htm">farm</a>er, the merchant, the <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y-lender, and the State. In order to avoid<br/>
an accidental and <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>itory inequality, shall <a href="we.htm">we</a> stay <a href="our.htm">our</a> hand from<br/>
righting an ancient wrong?<br/>
<br/>
The so-called practical <a href="object.htm">object</a>ions are not very formidable either. <a href="we.htm">We</a><br/>
are bidden to consider the hard case of some poor fellow who by dint of<br/>
privation has contrived to <a href="buy.htm">buy</a> a house just large enough to <a href="hold.htm">hold</a> his<br/>
family. And <a href="we.htm">we</a> are going to deprive him of his hard-earned happiness,<br/>
to turn him into the street! Certainly not. If his house is only just<br/>
large enough for his family, by all <a href="means.htm">means</a> let him stay there. Let him<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a> in his little garden, too; <a href="our.htm">our</a> "boys" will not hinder him--nay,<br/>
they will lend him a helping hand if <a href="need.htm">need</a> be. But suppose he lets<br/>
lodgings, suppose he has empty rooms in his house; then the people will<br/>
<a href="make.htm">make</a> the lodger understand that he <a href="need.htm">need</a> not <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> his former <a href="land.htm">land</a>lord any<br/>
more <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>. Stay where you are, but <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> <a href="free.htm">free</a>. No more duns and<br/>
collectors; Socialism has abolished all that!<br/>
<br/>
Or again, suppose that the <a href="land.htm">land</a>lord has a score of rooms all to himself,<br/>
and some poor woman lives near by with five children in one room. In<br/>
that case the people would see whether, with some alterations, these<br/>
empty rooms could not be con<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>ed into a suitable home for the poor<br/>
woman and her five children. Would not that be more just and fair than<br/>
to leave the mother and her five little ones <a href="lang.htm">lang</a>uishing in a garret,<br/>
while Sir Gorgeous Midas sat at his ease in an empty mansion? Besides,<br/>
<a href="good.htm">good</a> Sir Gorgeous would probably hasten to do it of his <a href="own.htm">own</a> accord; his<br/>
wife will be delighted to be <a href="free.htm">free</a>d from half her big, unwieldy house<br/>
when there is no longer a staff of <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ants to keep it in order.<br/>
<br/>
"So you are going to turn every<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> upside down," say the defenders of<br/>
<a href="law.htm">law</a> and order. "There will be no end to the evictions and removals.<br/>
Would it not be better to <a href="star.htm">star</a>t fresh by turning everybody out of doors<br/>
and redistributing the houses by lot?" Thus <a href="our.htm">our</a> critics; but <a href="we.htm">we</a> are<br/>
firmly persuaded that if no Government interferes in the <a href="matt.htm">matt</a>er, if all<br/>
the <a href="chang.htm">chang</a>es are entrusted to these <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="group.htm">group</a>s which have sprung up to<br/>
undertake the <a href="work.htm">work</a>, the evictions and removals will be less numerous<br/>
than those which take place in one year under the present system, owing<br/>
to the rapacity of <a href="land.htm">land</a>lords.<br/>
<br/>
In the first place, there are in all large towns almost enough empty<br/>
houses and flats to lodge all the inhabitants of the slums. As to the<br/>
palaces and suites of fine apartments, many <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing people would not<br/>
live in them if they could. One could not "keep up" such houses without<br/>
a large staff of <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ants. Their occupants would soon find themselves<br/>
forced to seek less luxurious dwellings. The fine ladies would find that<br/>
palaces were not well adapted to self-help in the kitchen. Gradually<br/>
people would shake down. There would be no <a href="need.htm">need</a> to conduct Dives to a<br/>
garret at the bayonet's <a href="point.htm">point</a>, or <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>all Lazarus in Dives's palace by<br/>
the help of an armed escort. People would shake down amicably into the<br/>
available dwellings with the least possible friction and disturbance.<br/>
Have <a href="we.htm">we</a> not the example of the village <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>es redistributing fields<br/>
and disturbing the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of the allotments so little that one can only<br/>
praise the intelligence and <a href="good.htm">good</a> sense of the methods they <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>? Fewer<br/>
fields <a href="chang.htm">chang</a>e hands under the management of the Russian <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>e than<br/>
where <a href="person.htm">person</a>al <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="hold.htm">hold</a>s sway, and is for ever <a href="carry.htm">carry</a>ing its<br/>
quarrels into courts of <a href="law.htm">law</a>. And are <a href="we.htm">we</a> to believe that the inhabitants<br/>
of a great European city would be less intelligent and less capable of<br/>
<a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization than Russian or Hindoo peasants?<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, <a href="we.htm">we</a> <a href="must.htm">must</a> not blink at the fact that every revolution <a href="means.htm">means</a> a<br/>
certain disturbance to everyday life, and those who expect this<br/>
tremendous climb out of the <a href="old.htm">old</a> grooves to be accomplished without so<br/>
much as jarring the dishes on their dinner tables will find themselves<br/>
mistaken. It is true that Governments can <a href="chang.htm">chang</a>e without disturbing<br/>
<a href="worth.htm">worth</a>y citizens at dinner, but the crimes of society towards those who<br/>
have nourished and sup<a href="port.htm">port</a>ed it are not to be redressed by any such<br/>
political sleight of parties.<br/>
<br/>
Undoubtedly there will be a disturbance, but it <a href="must.htm">must</a> not be one of pure<br/>
loss; it <a href="must.htm">must</a> be minimized. And again--it is impossible to lay too much<br/>
stress on this maxim--it will be by addressing <a href="our.htm">our</a>selves to the<br/>
<a href="interest.htm">interest</a>ed parties, and not to boards and <a href="commit.htm">commit</a>tees, that <a href="we.htm">we</a> shall best<br/>
succeed in reducing the sum of inconveniences for everybody.<br/>
<br/>
The people <a href="commit.htm">commit</a> blunder on blunder when they have to choose by ballot<br/>
some hare-brained candidate who solicits the honour of representing<br/>
them, and takes upon himself to know all, to do all, and to <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nize<br/>
all. But when they take upon themselves to <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nize what they know, what<br/>
touches them directly, they do it better than all the "talking-shops"<br/>
put together. Is not the Paris <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>e an <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ance in <a href="point.htm">point</a>? and the<br/>
great dockers' strike? and have <a href="we.htm">we</a> not constant evidence of this fact in<br/>
every village <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>e?<br/>

CHAPTER VII<br/>
<br/>
<a href="cloth.htm">CLOTH</a>ING<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When the houses have become the <a href="common.htm">common</a> heritage of the citizens, and<br/>
when each man has his daily supply of <a href="food.htm">food</a>, another forward step will<br/>
have to be taken. The question of <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>ing will of course demand<br/>
consideration next, and again the only possible <a href="solu.htm">solu</a>tion will be to take<br/>
possession, in the <a href="name.htm">name</a> of the people, of all the shops and warehouses<br/>
where <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>ing is <a href="sold.htm">sold</a> or stored, and to throw <a href="open.htm">open</a> the doors to all, so<br/>
that each can take what he <a href="need.htm">need</a>s. The <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>alization of <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>ing--the<br/>
right of each to take what he <a href="need.htm">need</a>s from the <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>al stores, or to have<br/>
it made for him at the tailors and outfitters--is a necessary corollary<br/>
of the <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>alization of houses and <a href="food.htm">food</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously <a href="we.htm">we</a> shall not <a href="need.htm">need</a> for that to despoil all citizens of their<br/>
coats, to put all the garments in a heap and draw lots for them, as <a href="our.htm">our</a><br/>
critics, with equal wit and ingenuity, suggest. Let him who has a coat<br/>
keep it still--nay, if he have ten coats it is highly improbable that<br/>
any one will <a href="want.htm">want</a> to deprive him of them, for most folk would prefer a<br/>
<a href="new.htm">new</a> coat to one that has already graced the shoulders of some fat<br/>
bourgeois; and there will be enough <a href="new.htm">new</a> garments, and to spare, without<br/>
having recourse to s<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>d-hand wardrobes.<br/>
<br/>
If <a href="we.htm">we</a> were to take an inventory of all the <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>es and stuff for<br/>
<a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>ing accumu<a href="late.htm">late</a>d in the shops and stores of the large towns, <a href="we.htm">we</a><br/>
should find probably that in Paris, Lyons, Bordeaux, and Marseilles,<br/>
there was enough to enable the <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>e to offer garments to all the<br/>
citizens, of <a href="bot.htm">bot</a>h sexes; and if all were not suited at once, the<br/>
<a href="commun.htm">commun</a>al outfitters would soon <a href="make.htm">make</a> <a href="good.htm">good</a> these shortcomings. <a href="we.htm">We</a> know how<br/>
rapidly <a href="our.htm">our</a> great tailoring and dressmaking establishments <a href="work.htm">work</a><br/>
nowadays, provided as they are with machinery specially adapted for<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion on a large scale.<br/>
<br/>
"But every one will <a href="want.htm">want</a> a sable-lined coat or a velvet gown!" exclaim<br/>
<a href="our.htm">our</a> adversaries.<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, <a href="we.htm">we</a> do not believe it. Every woman does not dote on velvet nor<br/>
does every man dream of sable linings. Even now, if <a href="we.htm">we</a> were to ask each<br/>
woman to choose her gown, <a href="we.htm">we</a> should find some to prefer a simple,<br/>
practical garment to all the fantastic trimmings the fashionable world<br/>
affects.<br/>
<br/>
Tastes <a href="chang.htm">chang</a>e with the <a href="time.htm">time</a>s, and the fashion in vogue at the <a href="time.htm">time</a> of<br/>
the Revolution will certainly <a href="make.htm">make</a> for simplicity. Societies, like<br/>
individuals, have their hours of cowardice, but also their heroic<br/>
moments; and though the society of to-day cuts a very poor figure <a href="sun.htm">sun</a>k<br/>
in the pursuit of narrow <a href="person.htm">person</a>al <a href="interest.htm">interest</a>s and s<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>d-rate ideas, it<br/>
wears a diffe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> air when great crises come. It has its moments of<br/>
greatness and enthusiasm. Men of generous nature will gain the power<br/>
which to-day is in the hand of jobbers. Self-<a href="dev.htm">dev</a>otion will spring up,<br/>
and noble deeds beget their like; even the egotists will be ashamed of<br/>
hanging back, and will be drawn in spite of themselves to admire, if not<br/>
to imitate, the generous and brave.<br/>
<br/>
The great Revolution of 1793 abounds in examples of this kind, and it is<br/>
always during such <a href="time.htm">time</a>s of spiritual revival--as natural to societies<br/>
as to individuals--that the spring-tide of enthusiasm sweeps humanity<br/>
onwards.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> do not wish to exaggerate the part played by such noble <a href="pass.htm">pass</a>ions, nor<br/>
is it upon them that <a href="we.htm">we</a> would found <a href="our.htm">our</a> ideal of society. But <a href="we.htm">we</a> are not<br/>
asking too much if <a href="we.htm">we</a> expect their aid in tiding over the first and most<br/>
difficult moments. <a href="we.htm">We</a> cannot hope that <a href="our.htm">our</a> daily life will be<br/>
continuously inspired by such exalted enthusiasms, but <a href="we.htm">we</a> may expect<br/>
their aid at the first, and that is all <a href="we.htm">we</a> <a href="need.htm">need</a>.<br/>
<br/>
It is just to <a href="wash.htm">wash</a> the earth <a href="clean.htm">clean</a>, to sweep away the <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>ds and refuse,<br/>
accumu<a href="late.htm">late</a>d by centuries of slavery and oppression, that the <a href="new.htm">new</a><br/>
anarchist society will have <a href="need.htm">need</a> of this wave of brotherly love. <a href="late.htm">Late</a>r<br/>
on it can exist without appealing to the spirit of self-sacrifice,<br/>
because it will have eliminated oppression, and thus <a href="creat.htm">creat</a>ed a <a href="new.htm">new</a> world<br/>
<a href="inst.htm">inst</a>inct with all the feelings of solidarity.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, should the character of the Revolution be such as <a href="we.htm">we</a> have<br/>
sketched here, the <a href="free.htm">free</a> initiative of individuals would find an<br/>
extensive field of <a href="act.htm">act</a>ion in thwarting the efforts of the egotists.<br/>
<a href="group.htm">Group</a>s would spring up in every street and quarter to undertake the<br/>
<a href="charg.htm">charg</a>e of the <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>ing. They would <a href="make.htm">make</a> inventories of all that the city<br/>
possessed, and would find out approximately what were the re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es at<br/>
their disposal. It is more than likely that in the <a href="matt.htm">matt</a>er of <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>ing<br/>
the citizens would adopt the same principle as in the <a href="matt.htm">matt</a>er of<br/>
provisions--that is to say, they would offer <a href="free.htm">free</a>ly from the <a href="common.htm">common</a><br/>
store every<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> which was to be found in <a href="abund.htm">abund</a>ance, and dole out<br/>
whatever was limited in quantity.<br/>
<br/>
Not being able to offer to each man a sable-lined coat and to every<br/>
woman a velvet gown, society would probably distinguish between the<br/>
superfluous and the necessary, and, provisionally at least <a href="class.htm">class</a> sable<br/>
and velvet among the superfluities of life, ready to let <a href="time.htm">time</a> prove<br/>
whether what is a luxury to-day may not become <a href="common.htm">common</a> to all to-morrow.<br/>
While the necessary <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>ing would be guaranteed to each inhabitant of<br/>
the anarchist city, it would be left to private <a href="act.htm">act</a>ivity to provide for<br/>
the sick and feeble those <a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s, provisionally considered as luxuries,<br/>
and to procure for the less robust such special articles, as would not<br/>
enter into the daily <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>ption of ordinary citizens.<br/>
<br/>
"But," it may be urged, "this <a href="means.htm">means</a> grey uniformity and the end of<br/>
every<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> beautiful in life and art."<br/>
<br/>
"Certainly not," <a href="we.htm">we</a> reply. And, still basing <a href="our.htm">our</a> reasonings on what<br/>
already exists, <a href="we.htm">we</a> are going to show how an Anarchist society could<br/>
satisfy the most artistic tastes of its citizens without allowing them<br/>
to amass the fortunes of millionaires.<br/>

CHAPTER VIII<br/>
<br/>
WAYS AND <a href="means.htm">MEANS</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I<br/>
<br/>
If a society, a city or a territory were to guarantee the necessaries of<br/>
life to its inhabitants <small>(and <a href="we.htm">we</a> shall see how the conception of the<br/>
necessaries of life can be so extended as to include luxuries)</small>, it would<br/>
be compelled to take possession of what is ab<a href="solu.htm">solu</a>tely <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed for<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion; that is to say--<a href="land.htm">land</a>, machinery, <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies, <a href="means.htm">means</a> of<br/>
<a href="trans.htm">trans</a><a href="port.htm">port</a>, etc. <a href="capital.htm">Capital</a> in the hands of private <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers would be<br/>
expropriated, to be <a href="return.htm">return</a>ed to the <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ity.<br/>
<br/>
The great harm done by bourgeois society, as <a href="we.htm">we</a> have already mentioned,<br/>
is not only that <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ists seize a large <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e of the <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s of each<br/>
industrial and <a href="commer.htm">commer</a>cial enterprise, thus enabling themselves to live<br/>
without <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing, but that all <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion has taken a wrong direction, as<br/>
it is not carried on with a view to <a href="secur.htm">secur</a>ing well-being to all. There is<br/>
the reason why it <a href="must.htm">must</a> be condemned.<br/>
<br/>
It is ab<a href="solu.htm">solu</a>tely impossible that mercantile <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion should be carried<br/>
on in the <a href="interest.htm">interest</a> of all. To desire it would be to expect the<br/>
<a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ist to go beyond his province and to fulfil duties that he<br/>
_cannot_ fulfil without ceasing to be what he is--a private manufacturer<br/>
seeking his <a href="own.htm">own</a> enrichment. <a href="capital.htm">Capital</a>ist <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization, based on the<br/>
<a href="person.htm">person</a>al <a href="interest.htm">interest</a> of each individual <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>er of labour, has given to<br/>
society all that could be expected of it: it has increased the<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive force of Labour. The <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ist, <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>ing by the revolution<br/>
effected in industry by s<a href="team.htm">team</a>, by the sudden <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>elopment of chemistry<br/>
and machinery, and by other inventions of <a href="our.htm">our</a> century, has <a href="work.htm">work</a>ed in his<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="interest.htm">interest</a> to increase the yield of human labour, and in a great<br/>
measure he has succeeded so far. But to attribute other duties to him<br/>
would be unreasonable. For example, to expect that he should <a href="use.htm">use</a> this<br/>
superior yield of labour in the <a href="interest.htm">interest</a> of society as a whole, would be<br/>
to ask philanthropy and charity of him, and a <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ist enterprise<br/>
cannot be based on charity.<br/>
<br/>
It now remains for society, first, to extend this greater <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tivity,<br/>
which is limited to certain industries, and to apply it to the general<br/>
<a href="good.htm">good</a>. But it is evident that to utilize this high <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tivity of<br/>
labour, so as to guarantee well-being to all, Society <a href="must.htm">must</a> itself take<br/>
possession of all <a href="means.htm">means</a> of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="econ.htm">Econ</a>omists, as is their wont, will not fail to remind <a href="us.htm">us</a> of the<br/>
comparative well-being of a certain category of young robust <a href="work.htm">work</a>men,<br/>
<a href="skill.htm">skill</a>ed in certain special branches of industry which has been obtained<br/>
under the present system. It is always this minority that is <a href="point.htm">point</a>ed out<br/>
to <a href="us.htm">us</a> with pride. But even this well-being, which is the exclusive right<br/>
of a few, is it <a href="secur.htm">secur</a>e? To-morrow, maybe, negligence, improvidence, or<br/>
the greed of their <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ers, will deprive these privileged men of their<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>, and they will <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for the period of comfort they have enjoyed with<br/>
months and years of po<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>y or destitution. How many im<a href="port.htm">port</a>ant<br/>
industries--the <a href="text.htm">text</a>iles, iron, sugar, etc.--without mentioning all<br/>
<a href="sort.htm">sort</a>s of short-lived <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>es, have <a href="we.htm">we</a> not seen decline or come to a<br/>
standstill on account of speculations, or in consequence of natural<br/>
displacement of <a href="work.htm">work</a>, or from the effects of competition amongst the<br/>
<a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ists themselves! If the chief <a href="text.htm">text</a>ile and mechanical industries<br/>
had to <a href="pass.htm">pass</a> through such a crisis as they have <a href="pass.htm">pass</a>ed through in 1886,<br/>
<a href="we.htm">we</a> hardly <a href="need.htm">need</a> mention the small <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>es, all of which have their periods<br/>
of standstill.<br/>
<br/>
What, too, shall <a href="we.htm">we</a> say to the <a href="price.htm">price</a> which is <a href="paid.htm">paid</a> for the relative<br/>
well-being of certain categories of <a href="work.htm">work</a>men? Unfortunately, it is <a href="paid.htm">paid</a><br/>
for by the ruin of <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture, the shameless exploitation of the<br/>
peasants, the misery of the masses. In comparison with the feeble<br/>
minority of <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers who enjoy a certain comfort, how many millions of<br/>
human beings live from hand to mouth, without a <a href="secur.htm">secur</a>e <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>, ready to<br/>
go wherever they are <a href="want.htm">want</a>ed; how many peasants <a href="work.htm">work</a> fourteen hours a day<br/>
for a poor pittance! <a href="capital.htm">Capital</a> depopu<a href="late.htm">late</a>s the country, exploits the<br/>
colonies and the countries where industries are but little <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>eloped,<br/>
dooms the immense majority of <a href="work.htm">work</a>men to remain without technical<br/>
education, to remain mediocre even in their <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
This is not merely accidental, it is a _necessity_ of the <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ist<br/>
system. In order well to remunerate certain <a href="class.htm">class</a>es of <a href="work.htm">work</a>men, peasants<br/>
_<a href="must.htm">must</a>_ become the beasts of burden of society; the country _<a href="must.htm">must</a>_ be<br/>
deserted for the town; small <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>es <a href="must.htm">must</a> agglomerate in the foul suburbs<br/>
of large cities, and manufacture a thousand little <a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s for next to<br/>
no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a>, so as to bring the <a href="good.htm">good</a>s of the greater industries within reach<br/>
of <a href="buy.htm">buy</a>ers with small salaries. That bad <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a> may be <a href="sold.htm">sold</a> to ill-<a href="paid.htm">paid</a><br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>ers, garments are made by tailors who are satisfied with a<br/>
<a href="star.htm">star</a>vation <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>! Eastern <a href="land.htm">land</a>s in a backward state are exploited by the<br/>
West, in order that, under the <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ist system, <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers in a few<br/>
privileged industries may obtain certain limited comforts of life.<br/>
<br/>
The evil of the present system is therefore not that the "<a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a>-<a href="valu.htm">valu</a>e"<br/>
of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion goes to the <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ist, as Rodbertus and Marx said, thus<br/>
narrowing the Socialist conception and the general view of the<br/>
<a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ist system; the <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a>-<a href="valu.htm">valu</a>e itself is but a consequence of<br/>
deeper causes. The evil lies _in the possibility of a <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a>-<a href="valu.htm">valu</a>e<br/>
existing_, <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ead of a simple <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a> not <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>ed by each generation;<br/>
for, that a <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a>-<a href="valu.htm">valu</a>e should exist, <a href="means.htm">means</a> that men, women and<br/>
children are compelled by hunger to <a href="sell.htm">sell</a> their labour for a small part<br/>
of what this labour <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>es, and still more so, of what their labour is<br/>
capable of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing: But this evil will last as long as the <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ruments<br/>
of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion belong to the few. As long as men are compelled to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> a<br/>
heavy tribute to <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="hold.htm">hold</a>ers for the right of cultivating <a href="land.htm">land</a> or<br/>
putting machinery into <a href="act.htm">act</a>ion, and the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of the <a href="land.htm">land</a> and the<br/>
machine are <a href="free.htm">free</a> to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e what bids fair to bring them in the largest<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s--rather than the greatest amount of <a href="use.htm">use</a>ful<br/>
commodities--well-being can only be temporarily guaranteed to a very<br/>
few; it is only to be bought by the po<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>y of a large section of<br/>
society. It is not sufficient to distribute the <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s realized by a<br/>
<a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e in equal parts, if at the same <a href="time.htm">time</a> thousands of other <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers are<br/>
exploited. It is a case of <a href="produc.htm">PRODUC</a>ING THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF <a href="good.htm">GOOD</a>S<br/>
NECESSARY TO THE WELL-BEING OF ALL, WITH THE LEAST POSSIBLE WASTE OF<br/>
HUMAN ENERGY.<br/>
<br/>
This generalized aim cannot be the aim of a private <a href="own.htm">own</a>er; and this is<br/>
why society as a whole, if it takes this view of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion as its<br/>
ideal, will be compelled to expropriate all that enhances well-being<br/>
while <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing wealth. It will have to take possession of <a href="land.htm">land</a>,<br/>
<a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies, mines, <a href="means.htm">means</a> of <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ication, etc., and besides, it will<br/>
have to study what <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts will promote general well-being, as well as<br/>
the ways and <a href="means.htm">means</a> of an adequate <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
II<br/>
<br/>
How many hours a day will man have to <a href="work.htm">work</a> to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e nourishing <a href="food.htm">food</a>, a<br/>
comfortable home, and necessary <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>ing for his family? This question<br/>
has often preoccupied Socialists, and they generally came to the<br/>
conclusion that four or five hours a day would suffice, on condition, be<br/>
it well understood, that all men <a href="work.htm">work</a>. At the end of last century,<br/>
Benjamin Franklin fixed the limit at five hours; and if the <a href="need.htm">need</a> of<br/>
comfort is greater now, the power of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion has augmented too, and<br/>
far more rapidly.<br/>
<br/>
In speaking of <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture further on, <a href="we.htm">we</a> shall see what the earth can<br/>
be made to yield to man when he cultivates it in a reasonable way,<br/>
<a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ead of throwing seed haphazard in a badly ploughed soil as he mostly<br/>
does to-day. In the great <a href="farm.htm">farm</a>s of Western America, some of which cover<br/>
30 square miles, but have a poorer soil than the manured soil of<br/>
civilized countries, only 10 to 15 English bushels per English acre are<br/>
obtained; that is to say, half the yield of European <a href="farm.htm">farm</a>s or of<br/>
American <a href="farm.htm">farm</a>s in the Eastern States. And ne<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>heless, thanks to<br/>
machines which enable 2 men to plough 4 English acres a day, 100 men can<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e in a year all that is necessary to deliver the <a href="bread.htm">bread</a> of 10,000<br/>
people at their homes during a whole year.<br/>
<br/>
Thus it would suffice for a man to <a href="work.htm">work</a> under the same conditions for<br/>
_30 hours, say 6 half-days of five hours each, to have <a href="bread.htm">bread</a> for a whole<br/>
year_; and to <a href="work.htm">work</a> 30 half-days to guarantee the same to a family of 5<br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> shall also prove by results obtained nowadays, that if <a href="we.htm">we</a> took<br/>
recourse to intensive <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture, less than 6 half-days' <a href="work.htm">work</a> could<br/>
procure <a href="bread.htm">bread</a>, meat, vegetables, and even luxurious fruit for a whole<br/>
family.<br/>
<br/>
Again, if <a href="we.htm">we</a> study the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of <a href="work.htm">work</a>men's dwellings, built in large towns<br/>
to-day, <a href="we.htm">we</a> can ascertain that to obtain, in a large English city, a<br/>
semi-detached little house, as they are built for <a href="work.htm">work</a>men for £250, from<br/>
1400 to 1800 half-days' <a href="work.htm">work</a> of 5 hours would be sufficient. And as a<br/>
house of that kind lasts 50 years at least, it follows that 28 to 36<br/>
half-days' <a href="work.htm">work</a> a year would provide well-furnished, <a href="heal.htm">heal</a>thy quarters,<br/>
with all necessary comfort for a family. Whereas when hiring the same<br/>
apartment from an <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>er, a <a href="work.htm">work</a>man <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s from 75 to 100 days' <a href="work.htm">work</a> per<br/>
year.<br/>
<br/>
Mark that these figures represent the maximum of what a house <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s in<br/>
Eng<a href="land.htm">land</a> to-day, being given the defective <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization of <a href="our.htm">our</a> societies.<br/>
In Belgium, <a href="work.htm">work</a>men's houses in the _cités ouvrières_ have been built at<br/>
a much smaller <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>. So that, taking every<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> into consideration, <a href="we.htm">we</a><br/>
are justified in affirming that in a well-<a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nized society 30 or 40<br/>
half-days' <a href="work.htm">work</a> a year will suffice to guarantee a perfectly comfortable<br/>
home.<br/>
<br/>
There now remains <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>ing, the exact <a href="valu.htm">valu</a>e of which is almost<br/>
impossible to fix, because the <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s realized by a swarm of middlemen<br/>
cannot be estimated. Let <a href="us.htm">us</a> take <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>, for example, and add up all the<br/>
tribute levied on every yard of it by the <a href="land.htm">land</a><a href="own.htm">own</a>ers, the sheep <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers,<br/>
the wool merchants, and all their in<a href="term.htm">term</a>ediate agents, then by the<br/>
railway companies, mill-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers, weavers, dealers in ready-made <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>es,<br/>
<a href="sell.htm">sell</a>ers and commission agents, and <a href="we.htm">we</a> shall get then an idea of what <a href="we.htm">we</a><br/>
<a href="pay.htm">pay</a> to a whole swarm of <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ists for each article of <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>ing. That<br/>
is why it is perfectly impossible to say how many days' <a href="work.htm">work</a> an overcoat<br/>
that you <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> £3 or £4 for in a large London shop represents.<br/>
<br/>
What is certain is that with present machinery it is possible to<br/>
manufacture an incredible amount of <a href="good.htm">good</a>s <a href="bot.htm">bot</a>h cheaply and quickly.<br/>
<br/>
A few examples will suffice. Thus in the United States, in 751 cotton<br/>
mills <small>(for spinning and weaving)</small>, 175,000 men and women <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e<br/>
2,033,000,000 yards of cotton <a href="good.htm">good</a>s, besides a great quantity of thread.<br/>
On the average, more than 12,000 yards of cotton <a href="good.htm">good</a>s alone are<br/>
obtained by a 300 days' <a href="work.htm">work</a> of nine and one-half hours each, say 40<br/>
yards of cotton in 10 hours. Admitting that a family <a href="need.htm">need</a>s 200 yards a<br/>
year at most, this would be equivalent to 50 hours' <a href="work.htm">work</a>, say _10<br/>
half-days of 5 hours each_. And <a href="we.htm">we</a> should have thread besides; that is<br/>
to say, cotton to sew with, and thread to weave <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a> with, so as to<br/>
manufacture woolen stuffs mixed with cotton.<br/>
<br/>
As to the results obtained by weaving alone, the official statistics of<br/>
the United States teach <a href="us.htm">us</a> that in 1870, if <a href="work.htm">work</a>men <a href="work.htm">work</a>ed 13 or 14<br/>
hours a day, they made 10,000 yards of white cotton <a href="good.htm">good</a>s in a year;<br/>
sixteen years <a href="late.htm">late</a>r <small>(1886)</small> they wove 30,000 yards by <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing only 55<br/>
hours a week.<br/>
<br/>
Even in <a href="print.htm">print</a>ed cotton <a href="good.htm">good</a>s they obtained, weaving and <a href="print.htm">print</a>ing<br/>
included, 32,000 yards in 2670 hours of <a href="work.htm">work</a> a year--say about 12 yards<br/>
an hour. Thus to have your 200 yards of white and <a href="print.htm">print</a>ed cotton <a href="good.htm">good</a>s<br/>
_17 hours' <a href="work.htm">work</a> a year_ would suffice. It is necessary to remark that<br/>
raw <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ial reaches these <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies in about the same state as it comes<br/>
from the fields, and that the <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>formations gone through by the piece<br/>
before it is con<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>ed into <a href="good.htm">good</a>s are completed in the course of these<br/>
17 hours. But to _<a href="buy.htm">buy</a>_ these 200 yards from the <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>esman, a well-<a href="paid.htm">paid</a><br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>man <a href="must.htm">must</a> give _at the very least_ 10 to 15 days' <a href="work.htm">work</a> of 10 hours<br/>
each, say 100 to 150 hours. And as to the English peasant, he would<br/>
have to toil for a month, or a little more, to obtain this luxury.<br/>
<br/>
By this example <a href="we.htm">we</a> already see that by <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing _50 half-days per year_<br/>
in a well-<a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nized society <a href="we.htm">we</a> could dress better than the lower middle<br/>
<a href="class.htm">class</a>es do to-day.<br/>
<br/>
But with all this <a href="we.htm">we</a> have only required 60 half-days' <a href="work.htm">work</a> of 5 hours<br/>
each to obtain the fruits of the earth, 40 for housing, and 50 for<br/>
<a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>ing, which only <a href="make.htm">make</a>s half a year's <a href="work.htm">work</a>, as the year consists of<br/>
300 <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing-days if <a href="we.htm">we</a> deduct holidays.<br/>
<br/>
There remain still 150 half-days' <a href="work.htm">work</a> which could be made <a href="use.htm">use</a> of for<br/>
other necessaries of life--<a href="win.htm">win</a>e, sugar, coffee, tea, furniture,<br/>
<a href="trans.htm">trans</a><a href="port.htm">port</a>, etc., etc.<br/>
<br/>
It is evident that these calculations are only approximative, but they<br/>
can also be proved in another way. When <a href="we.htm">we</a> take into account how many,<br/>
in the so-called civilized nations, <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a>, how many <a href="work.htm">work</a> at<br/>
harmful <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>es, doomed to disappear, and lastly, how many are only<br/>
<a href="use.htm">use</a>less middlemen, <a href="we.htm">we</a> see that in each nation the number of real<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ers could be doubled. And if, <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ead of every 10 men, 20 were<br/>
occupied in <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing <a href="use.htm">use</a>ful commodities, and if society took the<br/>
trouble to <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omize human energy, those 20 people would only have to<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a> 5 hours a day without <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion decreasing. And it would suffice<br/>
to reduce the waste of human energy which is going on in the rich<br/>
families with the scores of <a href="use.htm">use</a>less <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ants, or in the administrations<br/>
which occupy one official to every ten or even six inhabitants, and to<br/>
utilize those forces, to augment immensely the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tivity of a nation.<br/>
In fact, <a href="work.htm">work</a> could be reduced to four or even three hours a day, to<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e all the <a href="good.htm">good</a>s that are <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed now.<br/>
<br/>
After studying all these facts together, <a href="we.htm">we</a> may arrive, then, at the<br/>
following conclusion: Imagine a society, comprising a few million<br/>
inhabitants, engaged in <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture and a great variety of<br/>
industries--Paris, for example, with the Department of Seine-et-Oise.<br/>
Suppose that in this society all children learn to <a href="work.htm">work</a> with their hands<br/>
as well as with their brains. Admit that all adults, save women, engaged<br/>
in the education of their children, bind themselves to <a href="work.htm">work</a> _5 hours a<br/>
day_ from the age of twenty or twenty-two to forty-five or fifty, and<br/>
that they follow occupations they have chosen themselves in any one of<br/>
those branches of human <a href="work.htm">work</a> which in this city are considered<br/>
_necessary_. Such a society could in <a href="return.htm">return</a> guarantee well-being to all<br/>
its members, a well-being more substantial than that enjoyed to-day by<br/>
the middle <a href="class.htm">class</a>es. And, moreover, each <a href="work.htm">work</a>er belonging to this society<br/>
would have at his disposal at least 5 hours a day which he could <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>ote<br/>
to science, art, and individual <a href="need.htm">need</a>s which do not come under the<br/>
category of _necessities_, but will probably do so <a href="late.htm">late</a>r on, when man's<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tivity will have augmented, and those <a href="object.htm">object</a>s will no longer<br/>
appear luxurious or inaccessible.<br/>

<br/>
CHAPTER IX<br/>
<br/>
THE <a href="need.htm">NEED</a> FOR LUXURY<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I<br/>
<br/>
Man is not a being whose exclusive purpose in life is <a href="eat.htm">eat</a>ing, <a href="drink.htm">drink</a>ing,<br/>
and providing a <a href="shelter.htm">shelter</a> for himself. As soon as his <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ial <a href="want.htm">want</a>s are<br/>
satisfied, other <a href="need.htm">need</a>s, which, generally speaking, may be described as<br/>
of an artistic character, will thrust themselves forward. These <a href="need.htm">need</a>s<br/>
are of the greatest variety; they vary with each and every individual;<br/>
and the more society is civilized, the more will individuality be<br/>
<a href="dev.htm">dev</a>eloped, and the more will desires be varied.<br/>
<br/>
Even to-day <a href="we.htm">we</a> see men and women denying themselves necessaries to<br/>
acquire mere trifles, to obtain some particular gratification, or some<br/>
intellectual or <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ial enjoyment. A Christian or an ascetic may<br/>
disapprove of these desires for luxury; but it is precisely these<br/>
trifles that break the monotony of existence and <a href="make.htm">make</a> it <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>able.<br/>
Would life, with all its inevitable drudge and sorrows, be <a href="worth.htm">worth</a> living,<br/>
if, besides daily <a href="work.htm">work</a>, man could never obtain a single pleasure<br/>
according to his individual tastes?<br/>
<br/>
If <a href="we.htm">we</a> wish for a Social Revolution, it is no doubt, first of all, to<br/>
give <a href="bread.htm">bread</a> to everyone; to <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>form this execrable society, in which <a href="we.htm">we</a><br/>
can every day see capable <a href="work.htm">work</a>men dangling their arms for <a href="want.htm">want</a> of an<br/>
<a href="employ.htm">employ</a>er who will exploit them; women and children wandering <a href="shelter.htm">shelter</a>less<br/>
at night; whole families reduced to dry <a href="bread.htm">bread</a>; men, women, and children<br/>
dying for <a href="want.htm">want</a> of care and even for <a href="want.htm">want</a> of <a href="food.htm">food</a>. It is to put an end to<br/>
these iniquities that <a href="we.htm">we</a> rebel.<br/>
<br/>
But <a href="we.htm">we</a> expect more from the Revolution. <a href="we.htm">We</a> see that the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er,<br/>
compelled to struggle painfully for bare existence, is reduced to<br/>
ignore the higher delights, the highest within man's reach, of science,<br/>
and especially of scientific discovery; of art, and especially of<br/>
artistic <a href="creat.htm">creat</a>ion. It is in order to obtain for all of <a href="us.htm">us</a> joys that are<br/>
now re<a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ed to a few; in order to give leisure and the possibility of<br/>
<a href="dev.htm">dev</a>eloping everyone's intellectual capacities, that the social<br/>
revolution <a href="must.htm">must</a> guarantee daily <a href="bread.htm">bread</a> to all. After <a href="bread.htm">bread</a> has been<br/>
<a href="secur.htm">secur</a>ed, leisure is the supreme aim.<br/>
<br/>
No doubt, nowadays, when hundreds and thousands of human beings are in<br/>
<a href="need.htm">need</a> of <a href="bread.htm">bread</a>, coal, <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>ing, and <a href="shelter.htm">shelter</a>, luxury is a crime; to<br/>
satisfy it, the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er's child <a href="must.htm">must</a> go without <a href="bread.htm">bread</a>! But in a society<br/>
in which all have the necessary <a href="food.htm">food</a> and <a href="shelter.htm">shelter</a>, the <a href="need.htm">need</a>s which <a href="we.htm">we</a><br/>
consider luxuries to-day will be the more keenly felt. And as all men do<br/>
not and cannot resemble one another <small>(the variety of tastes and <a href="need.htm">need</a>s is<br/>
the chief guarantee of human progress)</small> there will always be, and it is<br/>
desirable that there should always be, men and women whose desire will<br/>
go beyond those of ordinary individuals in some particular direction.<br/>
<br/>
Everybody does not <a href="need.htm">need</a> a telescope, because, even if learning were<br/>
general, there are people who prefer to examine <a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s through a<br/>
microscope to studying the <a href="star.htm">star</a>ry heavens. Some like statues, some like<br/>
pictures. A particular individual has no other ambition than to possess<br/>
a <a href="good.htm">good</a> piano, while another is pleased with an accordion. The tastes<br/>
vary, but the artistic <a href="need.htm">need</a>s exist in all. In <a href="our.htm">our</a> present, poor<br/>
<a href="capital.htm">capital</a>istic society, the man who has artistic <a href="need.htm">need</a>s cannot satisfy them<br/>
unless he is heir to a large fortune, or by dint of hard <a href="work.htm">work</a><br/>
appropriates to himself an intellectual <a href="capital.htm">capital</a> which will enable him to<br/>
take up a liberal profession. Still he cherishes the _hope_ of some day<br/>
satisfying his tastes more or less, and for this reason he reproaches<br/>
the idealist <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ist societies with having the <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ial life of each<br/>
individual as their sole aim. "In your <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>al stores you may perhaps<br/>
have <a href="bread.htm">bread</a> for all," he says to <a href="us.htm">us</a>, "but you will not have beautiful<br/>
pictures, optical <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ruments, luxurious furniture, artistic jewelry--in<br/>
short, the many <a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s that minister to the infinite variety of human<br/>
tastes. And you suppress the possibility of obtaining any<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> besides<br/>
the <a href="bread.htm">bread</a> and meat which the <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>e can offer to all, and the drab<br/>
linen in which all your lady citizens will be dressed."<br/>
<br/>
These are the <a href="object.htm">object</a>ions which all <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ist systems have to consider,<br/>
and which the founders of <a href="new.htm">new</a> societies, established in American<br/>
deserts, never understood. They believed that if the <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ity could<br/>
procure sufficient <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a> to dress all its members, a <a href="music.htm">music</a>-room in which<br/>
the "brothers" could strum a piece of <a href="music.htm">music</a>, or <a href="act.htm">act</a> a play from <a href="time.htm">time</a> to<br/>
<a href="time.htm">time</a>, it was enough. They forgot that the feeling for art existed in the<br/>
<a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culturist as well as in the burgher, and, notwithstanding that the<br/>
expression of artistic feeling varies according to the difference in<br/>
culture, in the main it remains the same. In vain did the <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ity<br/>
guarantee the <a href="common.htm">common</a> necessaries of life, in vain did it suppress all<br/>
education that would tend to <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>elop individuality, in vain did it<br/>
eliminate all reading save the Bible. Individual tastes broke forth, and<br/>
caused general discontent; quarrels arose when somebody proposed to <a href="buy.htm">buy</a><br/>
a piano or scientific <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ruments; and the elements of progress flagged.<br/>
The society could only exist on condition that it crushed all individual<br/>
feeling, all artistic tendency, and all <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>elopment.<br/>
<br/>
Will the anarchist <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>e be impelled by the same direction?--Evidently<br/>
not, if it understands that while it <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>es all that is necessary to<br/>
<a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ial life, it <a href="must.htm">must</a> also strive to satisfy all manifestations of the<br/>
human mind.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
II<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> frankly confess that when <a href="we.htm">we</a> think of the abyss of po<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>y and<br/>
suffering that surrounds <a href="us.htm">us</a>, when <a href="we.htm">we</a> hear the heartrending cry of the<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>er walking the streets begging for <a href="work.htm">work</a>, <a href="we.htm">we</a> are loth to discuss the<br/>
question: How will men <a href="act.htm">act</a> in a society, whose members are <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ly fed,<br/>
to satisfy certain individuals desirous of possessing a piece of Sèvres<br/>
china or a velvet dress?<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> are tempted to answer: Let <a href="us.htm">us</a> <a href="make.htm">make</a> sure of <a href="bread.htm">bread</a> to begin with, <a href="we.htm">we</a><br/>
shall see to china and velvet <a href="late.htm">late</a>r on.<br/>
<br/>
But as <a href="we.htm">we</a> <a href="must.htm">must</a> recognize that man has other <a href="need.htm">need</a>s besides <a href="food.htm">food</a>, and as<br/>
the strength of Anarchy lies precisely in that that it understands _all_<br/>
human faculties and _all_ <a href="pass.htm">pass</a>ions, and ignores none, <a href="we.htm">we</a> shall, in a few<br/>
<a href="word.htm">word</a>s, explain how man can contrive to satisfy all his intellectual and<br/>
artistic <a href="need.htm">need</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> have already mentioned that by <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing 4 or 5 hours a day till the<br/>
age of forty-five or fifty, man could easily <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e _all_ that is<br/>
necessary to guarantee comfort to society.<br/>
<br/>
But the day's <a href="work.htm">work</a> of a man ac<a href="cust.htm">cust</a>omed to toil does not consist of 5<br/>
hours; it is a 10 hours' day for 300 days a year, and lasts all his<br/>
life. Of course, when a man is harnessed to a machine, his <a href="heal.htm">heal</a>th is<br/>
soon undermined and his intelligence is blunted; but when man has the<br/>
possibility of varying occupations, and especially of alternating manual<br/>
with intellectual <a href="work.htm">work</a>, he can remain occupied without fatigue, and even<br/>
with pleasure, for 10 or 12 hours a day. Consequently, the man who will<br/>
have done the 4 or 5 hours of manual <a href="work.htm">work</a> that are necessary for his<br/>
existence, will have before him 5 or 6 hours which he will seek to<br/>
<a href="employ.htm">employ</a> according to his tastes. And these 5 or 6 hours a day will fully<br/>
enable him to procure for himself, if he associates with others, all he<br/>
wishes for, in addition to the necessaries guaranteed to all.<br/>
<br/>
He will dis<a href="charg.htm">charg</a>e first his task in the field, the <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>y, and so on,<br/>
which he owes to society as his contribution to the general <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
And he will <a href="employ.htm">employ</a> the s<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>d half of his day, his week, or his year, to<br/>
satisfy his artistic or scientific <a href="need.htm">need</a>s, or his hobbies.<br/>
<br/>
Thousands of societies will spring up to gratify every taste and every<br/>
possible fancy.<br/>
<br/>
Some, for example, will give their hours of leisure to literature. They<br/>
will then form <a href="group.htm">group</a>s comprising authors, compositors, <a href="print.htm">print</a>ers,<br/>
engravers, draughtsmen, all pursuing a <a href="common.htm">common</a> aim--the propagation of<br/>
ideas that are dear to them.<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays an author knows that there is a beast of burden, the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er, to<br/>
whom, for the sum of a few shillings a day, he can entrust the <a href="print.htm">print</a>ing<br/>
of his books; but he hardly cares to know what a <a href="print.htm">print</a>ing office is<br/>
like. If the compositor suffers from lead-poisoning, and if the child<br/>
who sees to the machine dies of anæmia, are there not other poor<br/>
wretches to replace them?<br/>
<br/>
But when there will be no more <a href="star.htm">star</a>velings ready to <a href="sell.htm">sell</a> their <a href="work.htm">work</a> for<br/>
a pittance, when the exploited <a href="work.htm">work</a>er of to-day will be educated, and<br/>
will have his _<a href="own.htm">own</a>_ ideas to put down in black and white and to<br/>
<a href="commun.htm">commun</a>icate to others, then the authors and scientific men will be<br/>
compelled to combine among themselves and with the <a href="print.htm">print</a>ers, in order to<br/>
bring out their prose and their poetry.<br/>
<br/>
So long as men consider fustian and manual labour a mark of inferiority,<br/>
it will appear amazing to them to see an author setting up his <a href="own.htm">own</a> book<br/>
in <a href="type.htm">type</a>, for has he not a gymnasium or <a href="game.htm">game</a>s by way of diversion? But<br/>
when the opprobrium connected with manual <a href="labor.htm">labor</a> has disappeared, when<br/>
all will have to <a href="work.htm">work</a> with their hands, there being no one to do it for<br/>
them, then the authors as well as their admirers will soon learn the art<br/>
of handling composing-sticks and <a href="type.htm">type</a>; they will know the pleasure of<br/>
coming together--all admirers of the <a href="work.htm">work</a> to be <a href="print.htm">print</a>ed--to set up the<br/>
<a href="type.htm">type</a>, to shape it into pages, to take it in its virginal purity from the<br/>
press. These beautiful machines, <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ruments of torture to the child who<br/>
attends on them from morn till night, will be a <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e of enjoyment for<br/>
those who will <a href="make.htm">make</a> <a href="use.htm">use</a> of them in order to give voice to the thoughts<br/>
of their favourite author.<br/>
<br/>
Will literature lose by it? Will the poet be less a poet after having<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>ed out of doors or helped with his hands to multiply his <a href="work.htm">work</a>? Will<br/>
the novelist lose his knowledge of human nature after having rubbed<br/>
shoulders with other men in the forest or the <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>y, in the laying out<br/>
of a road or on a railway line? Can there be two answers to these<br/>
questions?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe some books will be less voluminous; but then, more will be said on<br/>
fewer pages. Maybe fewer waste-sheets will be published; but the <a href="matt.htm">matt</a>er<br/>
<a href="print.htm">print</a>ed will be more attentively read and more appreciated. The book<br/>
will appeal to a larger circle of better educated readers, who will be<br/>
more competent to judge.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, the art of <a href="print.htm">print</a>ing, that has so little progressed since<br/>
Gutenberg, is still in its infancy. It takes two hours to compose in<br/>
<a href="type.htm">type</a> what is written in ten minutes, but more expeditious methods of<br/>
multiplying thought are being sought after and will be discovered.<small>[6]</small><br/>
<br/>
What a pity every author does not have to take his <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e in the <a href="print.htm">print</a>ing<br/>
of his <a href="work.htm">work</a>s! What progress <a href="print.htm">print</a>ing would have already made! <a href="we.htm">We</a> should<br/>
no longer be using movable letters, as in the seventeenth century.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
III<br/>
<br/>
Is it a dream to conceive a society in which--all having become<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ers, all having received an education that enables them to<br/>
cultivate science or art, and all having leisure to do so--men would<br/>
combine to publish the <a href="work.htm">work</a>s of their choice, by contributing each his<br/>
<a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e of manual <a href="work.htm">work</a>? <a href="we.htm">We</a> have already hundreds of learned, literary, and<br/>
other societies; and these societies are no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> but voluntary <a href="group.htm">group</a>s of<br/>
men, <a href="interest.htm">interest</a>ed in certain branches of learning, and associated for the<br/>
purpose of publishing their <a href="work.htm">work</a>s. The authors who write for the<br/>
periodicals of these societies are not <a href="paid.htm">paid</a>, and the periodicals, apart<br/>
from a limited number of <a href="copi.htm">copi</a>es, are not for sale; they are sent gratis<br/>
to all quarters of the globe, to other societies, cultivating the same<br/>
branches of learning. This member of the Society may insert in its<br/>
review a one-page <a href="note.htm">note</a> summarizing his ob<a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ations; another may publish<br/>
therein an extensive <a href="work.htm">work</a>, the results of long years of study; while<br/>
others will confine themselves to consulting the review as a<br/>
<a href="star.htm">star</a>ting-<a href="point.htm">point</a> for further research. It does not <a href="matt.htm">matt</a>er: all these<br/>
authors and readers are associated for the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion of <a href="work.htm">work</a>s in which<br/>
all of them take an <a href="interest.htm">interest</a>.<br/>
<br/>
It is true that a learned society, like the individual author, goes to a<br/>
<a href="print.htm">print</a>ing office where <a href="work.htm">work</a>men are engaged to do the <a href="print.htm">print</a>ing. Nowadays,<br/>
those who belong to the learned societies despise manual labour which<br/>
indeed is carried on under very bad conditions; but a <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ity which<br/>
would give a generous philosophic and _scientific_ education to all its<br/>
members, would know how to <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nize manual labour in such a way that it<br/>
would be the pride of humanity. Its learned societies would become<br/>
associations of explorers, lovers of science, and <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers--all knowing a<br/>
manual <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e and all <a href="interest.htm">interest</a>ed in science.<br/>
<br/>
If, for example, the Society is studying geology, all will contribute to<br/>
the exploration of the earth's strata; each member will take his <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e<br/>
in research, and ten thousand ob<a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ers, where <a href="we.htm">we</a> have now only a<br/>
hundred, will do more in a year than <a href="we.htm">we</a> can do in twenty years. And when<br/>
their <a href="work.htm">work</a>s are to be published, ten thousand men and women, <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>ed in<br/>
diffe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>es, will be ready to draw maps, engrave designs, compose,<br/>
and <a href="print.htm">print</a> the books. With gladness will they give their leisure--in<br/>
summer to exploration, in <a href="win.htm">win</a>ter to indoor <a href="work.htm">work</a>. And when their <a href="work.htm">work</a>s<br/>
appear, they will find not only a hundred, but ten thousand readers<br/>
<a href="interest.htm">interest</a>ed in their <a href="common.htm">common</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
This is the direction in which progress is already moving. Even to-day,<br/>
when Eng<a href="land.htm">land</a> felt the <a href="need.htm">need</a> of a complete dictionary of the English<br/>
<a href="lang.htm">lang</a>uage, the birth of a Littré, who would <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>ote his life to this <a href="work.htm">work</a>,<br/>
was not waited for. Volunteers were appealed to, and a thousand men<br/>
offered their <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ices, spontaneously and gratuitously, to ransack the<br/>
libraries, to take <a href="note.htm">note</a>s, and to accomplish in a few years a <a href="work.htm">work</a> which<br/>
one man could not complete in his life<a href="time.htm">time</a>. In all branches of human<br/>
intelligence the same spirit is breaking forth, and <a href="we.htm">we</a> should have a<br/>
very limited knowledge of humanity could <a href="we.htm">we</a> not guess that the <a href="future.htm">future</a> is<br/>
announcing itself in such tentative co-operation, which is gradually<br/>
taking the place of individual <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
For this dictionary to be a really collective <a href="work.htm">work</a>, it would have been<br/>
necessary that many volunteer authors, <a href="print.htm">print</a>ers, and <a href="print.htm">print</a>ers' readers<br/>
should have <a href="work.htm">work</a>ed in <a href="common.htm">common</a>; but some<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> in this direction is done<br/>
already in the Socialist Press, which offers <a href="us.htm">us</a> examples of manual and<br/>
intellectual <a href="work.htm">work</a> combined. It happens in <a href="our.htm">our</a> <a href="new.htm">new</a>spapers that a<br/>
Socialist author composes in lead his <a href="own.htm">own</a> article. True, such attempts<br/>
are rare, but they indicate in which direction evolution is going.<br/>
<br/>
They show the road of liberty. In <a href="future.htm">future</a>, when a man will have some<a href="thing.htm">thing</a><br/>
<a href="use.htm">use</a>ful to say--a <a href="word.htm">word</a> that goes beyond the thoughts of his century, he<br/>
will not have to look for an editor who might advance the necessary<br/>
<a href="capital.htm">capital</a>. He will look for col<a href="labor.htm">labor</a>ators among those who know the<br/>
<a href="print.htm">print</a>ing <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e, and who approve the idea of his <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a>. Together they<br/>
will publish the <a href="new.htm">new</a> book or journal.<br/>
<br/>
Literature and journalism will cease to be a <a href="means.htm">means</a> of <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y-making and<br/>
living at the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of others. But is there any one who knows literature<br/>
and journalism from within, and who does not ardently desire that<br/>
literature should at last be able to <a href="free.htm">free</a> itself from those who formerly<br/>
<a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ed it, and who now exploit it, and from the multitude, which,<br/>
with rare exceptions, <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s for it in pro<a href="port.htm">port</a>ion to its mediocrity, or to<br/>
the ease with which it adapts itself to the bad taste o£ the greater<br/>
number?<br/>
<br/>
Letters and science will only take their <a href="proper.htm">proper</a> place in the <a href="work.htm">work</a> of<br/>
human <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>elopment when, <a href="free.htm">free</a>d from all mercenary bondage, they will be<br/>
exclusively cultivated by those who love them, and for those who love<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
IV<br/>
<br/>
Literature, science, and art <a href="must.htm">must</a> be cultivated by <a href="free.htm">free</a> men. Only on<br/>
this condition will they succeed in emancipating themselves from the<br/>
yoke of the State, of <a href="capital.htm">Capital</a>, and of the bourgeois mediocrity which<br/>
stifles them.<br/>
<br/>
What <a href="means.htm">means</a> has the scientist of to-day to <a href="make.htm">make</a> researches that <a href="interest.htm">interest</a><br/>
him? Should he ask help of the State, which can only be given to one<br/>
candidate in a hundred, and which only he may obtain who <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>es<br/>
ostensibly to keep to the beaten track? Let <a href="us.htm">us</a> remember how the Academy<br/>
of Sciences of France repudiated Darwin, how the Academy of St.<br/>
Petersburg treated Mendeléeff with contempt, and how the Royal Society<br/>
of London refused to publish Joule's paper, in which he de<a href="term.htm">term</a>ined the<br/>
mechanical equivalent of heat, finding it "unscientific."<small>[7]</small><br/>
<br/>
It was why all great researches, all discoveries revolutionizing<br/>
science, have been made outside academies and universities, either by<br/>
men rich enough to remain independent, like Darwin and Lyell, or by men<br/>
who undermined their <a href="heal.htm">heal</a>th by <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing in po<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>y, and often in great<br/>
straits, losing endless <a href="time.htm">time</a> for <a href="want.htm">want</a> of a <a href="labor.htm">labor</a>atory, and unable to<br/>
procure the <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ruments or books necessary to continue their researches,<br/>
but persevering aga<a href="inst.htm">inst</a> hope, and often dying before they had reached<br/>
the end in view. Their <a href="name.htm">name</a> is legion.<br/>
<br/>
Altogether, the system of help granted by the State is so bad that<br/>
science has always endeavoured to emancipate itself from it. For this<br/>
very reason there are thousands of learned societies <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nized and<br/>
maintained by volunteers in Europe and America,--some having <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>eloped<br/>
to such a degree that all the re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of subventioned societies, and<br/>
all the wealth of millionaires, would not <a href="buy.htm">buy</a> their treasures. No<br/>
governmental <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>itution is as rich as the Zoological Society of London,<br/>
which is sup<a href="port.htm">port</a>ed by voluntary contributions.<br/>
<br/>
It does not <a href="buy.htm">buy</a> the <a href="animal.htm">animal</a>s which in thousands people its gardens: they<br/>
are sent by other societies and by collectors of the entire world. The<br/>
Zoological Society of Bombay will send an elephant as a gift; another<br/>
<a href="time.htm">time</a> a hippopotamus or a rhinoceros is offered by Egyptian naturalists.<br/>
And these magnificent presents are pouring in every day, arriving from<br/>
all quarters of the globe--birds, reptiles, collections of insects, etc.<br/>
Such consignments often comprise <a href="animal.htm">animal</a>s that could not be bought for<br/>
all the <a href="gold.htm">gold</a> in the world; thus a traveller who has captured an <a href="animal.htm">animal</a><br/>
at life's peril, and now loves it as he would love a child, will give it<br/>
to the Society because he is sure it will be cared for. The entrance fee<br/>
<a href="paid.htm">paid</a> by visitors, and they are numberless, suffices for the maintenance<br/>
of that immense <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>itution.<br/>
<br/>
What is defective in the Zoological Society of London, and in other<br/>
kindred societies, is that the member's fee cannot be <a href="paid.htm">paid</a> in <a href="work.htm">work</a>; that<br/>
the keepers and numerous <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>es of this large <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>itution are not<br/>
recognized as members of the Society, while many have no other incentive<br/>
to <a href="join.htm">join</a>ing the society than to put the cabalistic letters F.Z.S <small>(Fellow<br/>
of the Zoological Society)</small> on their cards. In a <a href="word.htm">word</a>, what is <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed is<br/>
a more perfect co-operation.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> may say the same about inventors, that <a href="we.htm">we</a> have said of scientists.<br/>
Who does not know what sufferings n<a href="early.htm">early</a> all great inventions have <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>?<br/>
Sleepless nights, families deprived of <a href="bread.htm">bread</a>, <a href="want.htm">want</a> of tools and<br/>
<a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ials for experiments, this is the history of n<a href="early.htm">early</a> all those who<br/>
have enriched industry with inventions which are the truly legitimate<br/>
pride of <a href="our.htm">our</a> civilization.<br/>
<br/>
But what are <a href="we.htm">we</a> to do to alter the conditions that everybody is<br/>
convinced are bad? Patents have been tried, and <a href="we.htm">we</a> know with what<br/>
results. The inventor <a href="sell.htm">sell</a>s his patent for a few pounds, and the man who<br/>
has only lent the <a href="capital.htm">capital</a> pockets the enormous <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s often resulting<br/>
from the invention. Besides, patents iso<a href="late.htm">late</a> the inventor. They compel<br/>
him to keep secret his researches which therefore end in failure;<br/>
whereas the simplest suggestion, coming from a brain less absorbed in<br/>
the fundamental idea, some<a href="time.htm">time</a>s suffices to fertilize the invention and<br/>
<a href="make.htm">make</a> it practical. Like all State <a href="control.htm">control</a>, patents hamper the progress<br/>
of industry. Thought being incapable of being patented, patents are a<br/>
crying injustice in theory, and in practice they result in one of the<br/>
great obstacles to the rapid <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>elopment of invention.<br/>
<br/>
What is <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed to promote the spirit of invention is, first of all, the<br/>
awakening of thought, the boldness of conception, which <a href="our.htm">our</a> entire<br/>
education causes to <a href="lang.htm">lang</a>uish; it is the spreading of a scientific<br/>
education, which would increase the number of inquirers a hundredfold;<br/>
it is faith that humanity is going to take a step forward, because it is<br/>
enthusiasm, the hope of doing <a href="good.htm">good</a>, that has inspired all the great<br/>
inventors. The Social Revolution alone can give this impulse to thought,<br/>
this boldness, this knowledge, this conviction of <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing for all.<br/>
<br/>
Then <a href="we.htm">we</a> shall have vast <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>itutes supplied with motor-power and tools<br/>
of all <a href="sort.htm">sort</a>s, immense industrial <a href="labor.htm">labor</a>atories <a href="open.htm">open</a> to all inquirers,<br/>
where men will be able to <a href="work.htm">work</a> out their dreams, after having acquitted<br/>
themselves of their duty towards society; machinery palaces where they<br/>
will spend their five or six hours of leisure; where they will <a href="make.htm">make</a><br/>
their experiments; where they will find other comrades, experts in other<br/>
branches of industry, likewise coming to study some difficult problem,<br/>
and therefore able to help and enlighten each other,--the encounter of<br/>
their ideas and experience causing the longed-for <a href="solu.htm">solu</a>tion to be found.<br/>
And yet again, this is no dream. Solanóy Gorodók, in Petersburg, has<br/>
already partially realized it as regards technical <a href="matt.htm">matt</a>ers. It is a<br/>
<a href="factor.htm">factor</a>y well furnished with tools and <a href="free.htm">free</a> to all; tools and motor-power<br/>
are supplied gratis, only <a href="meta.htm">meta</a>ls and wood are <a href="charg.htm">charg</a>ed for at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <a href="price.htm">price</a>.<br/>
Unfortunately <a href="work.htm">work</a>men only go there at night when worn out by ten hours'<br/>
labour in the <a href="work.htm">work</a>shop. Moreover, they carefully hide their inventions<br/>
from each other, as they are hampered by patents and <a href="capital.htm">Capital</a>ism--that<br/>
bane of present society, that stumbling-b<a href="lock.htm">lock</a> in the path of<br/>
intellectual and moral progress.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
V<br/>
<br/>
And what about art? From all sides <a href="we.htm">we</a> hear lamentations about the<br/>
decadence of art. <a href="we.htm">We</a> are, indeed, far behind the great masters of the<br/>
Renaissance. The technicalities of art have recently made great<br/>
progress; thousands of people gifted with a certain amount of talent<br/>
cultivate every branch, but art seems to fly from civilization!<br/>
Technicalities <a href="make.htm">make</a> headway, but inspiration frequents artists' studios<br/>
less than ever.<br/>
<br/>
Where, indeed, should it come from? Only a grand idea can inspire art.<br/>
_Art_ is in <a href="our.htm">our</a> ideal synonymous with <a href="creat.htm">creat</a>ion, it <a href="must.htm">must</a> look ahead; but<br/>
save a few rare, very rare exceptions, the professional artist remains<br/>
too philistine to perceive <a href="new.htm">new</a> horizons.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, this inspiration cannot come from books; it <a href="must.htm">must</a> be drawn from<br/>
life, and present society cannot arouse it.<br/>
<br/>
Raphael and Murillo painted at a <a href="time.htm">time</a> when the search of a <a href="new.htm">new</a> ideal<br/>
could be pursued while retaining the <a href="old.htm">old</a> religious <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itions. They<br/>
painted to decorate churches which themselves represented the pious <a href="work.htm">work</a><br/>
of several generations of a given city. The basilic with its mysterious<br/>
aspect, its grandeur, was connected with the life itself of the city,<br/>
and could inspire a painter. He <a href="work.htm">work</a>ed for a popular monument; he spoke<br/>
to his fellow-citizens, and in <a href="return.htm">return</a> he received inspiration; he<br/>
appealed to the multitude in the same way as did the nave, the pillars,<br/>
the stained <a href="window.htm">window</a>s, the statues, and the carved doors. Nowadays the<br/>
greatest honour a painter can aspire to is to see his canvas, framed in<br/>
gilded wood, hung in a museum, a <a href="sort.htm">sort</a> of <a href="old.htm">old</a> <a href="cur.htm">cur</a>iosity shop, where you<br/>
see, as in the Prado, Murillo's Ascension next to a beggar of Velasquez<br/>
and the dogs of Philip II. Poor Velasquez and poor Murillo! Poor Greek<br/>
statues which _lived_ in the Acropolis of their cities, and are now<br/>
stifled <a href="bene.htm">bene</a>ath the red <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a> hangings of the Louvre!<br/>
<br/>
When a Greek sculptor chiseled his marble he endeavored to express the<br/>
spirit and heart of the city. All its <a href="pass.htm">pass</a>ions, all its <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itions of<br/>
glory, were to live again in the <a href="work.htm">work</a>. But to-day the _united_ city has<br/>
ceased to exist; there is no more <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ion of ideas. The town is a<br/>
chance agglomeration of people who do not know one another, who have no<br/>
<a href="common.htm">common</a> <a href="interest.htm">interest</a>, save that of enriching themselves at the expense of one<br/>
another. The father<a href="land.htm">land</a> does not exist.... What father<a href="land.htm">land</a> can the<br/>
international banker and the rag-picker have in <a href="common.htm">common</a>? Only when<br/>
cities, territories, nations, or <a href="group.htm">group</a>s of nations, will have renewed<br/>
their harmonious life, will art be able to draw its inspiration from<br/>
_ideals held in <a href="common.htm">common</a>_. Then will the architect conceive the city's<br/>
monument which will no longer be a temple, a prison, or a fortress;<br/>
then will the painter, the sculptor, the carver, the or<a href="name.htm">name</a>nt-<a href="work.htm">work</a>er<br/>
know where to put their canvases, their statues, and their decoration;<br/>
deriving their power of execution from the same vital <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e, and<br/>
gloriously marching all together towards the <a href="future.htm">future</a>.<br/>
<br/>
But till then art can only vegetate. The best canvases of <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern artists<br/>
are those that represent nature, villages, valleys, the sea with its<br/>
dangers, the mountain with its splendours. But how can the painter<br/>
express the poetry of <a href="work.htm">work</a> in the fields if he has only contemp<a href="late.htm">late</a>d it,<br/>
imagined it, if he has never delighted in it himself? If he only knows<br/>
it as a bird of <a href="pass.htm">pass</a>age knows the country he soars over in his<br/>
migrations? If, in the vigour of <a href="early.htm">early</a> youth, he has not followed the<br/>
plough at dawn, and enjoyed mowing grass with a large sweep of the<br/>
scythe next to hardy hay<a href="make.htm">make</a>rs vying in energy with lively young girls<br/>
who fill the air with their songs? The love of the soil and of what<br/>
<a href="grow.htm">grow</a>s on it is not acquired by sketching with a paint-brush--it is only<br/>
in its <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ice; and without loving it, how paint it? This is why all<br/>
that the best painters have <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed in this direction is still so<br/>
imperfect, not true to life, n<a href="early.htm">early</a> always merely sen<a href="time.htm">time</a>ntal. There is<br/>
no _strength_ in it.<br/>
<br/>
You <a href="must.htm">must</a> have seen a <a href="sun.htm">sun</a>set when <a href="return.htm">return</a>ing from <a href="work.htm">work</a>. You <a href="must.htm">must</a> have been<br/>
a peasant among peasants to keep the splendour of it in your eye. You<br/>
<a href="must.htm">must</a> have been at sea with <a href="fish.htm">fish</a>ermen at all hours of the day and night,<br/>
have <a href="fish.htm">fish</a>ed yourself, struggled with the waves, faced the storm, and<br/>
after rough <a href="work.htm">work</a> experienced the joy of hauling a heavy net, or the<br/>
disap<a href="point.htm">point</a>ment of seeing it empty, to understand the poetry of <a href="fish.htm">fish</a>ing.<br/>
You <a href="must.htm">must</a> have spent <a href="time.htm">time</a> in a <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>y, known the fatigues and the joys<br/>
of <a href="creat.htm">creat</a>ive <a href="work.htm">work</a>, forged <a href="meta.htm">meta</a>ls by the vivid light of a blast furnace,<br/>
have felt the life in a machine, to understand the power of man and to<br/>
express it in a <a href="work.htm">work</a> of art. You <a href="must.htm">must</a>, in fact, be permeated with<br/>
popular feelings, to describe them.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, the <a href="work.htm">work</a>s of <a href="future.htm">future</a> artists who will have lived the life of<br/>
the people, like the great artists of the <a href="past.htm">past</a>, will not be destined for<br/>
sale. They will be an integral part of a living whole that would not be<br/>
complete without them, any more than they would be complete without it.<br/>
Men will go to the artist's <a href="own.htm">own</a> city to gaze at his <a href="work.htm">work</a>, and the<br/>
spirited and serene beauty of such <a href="creat.htm">creat</a>ions will <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e its <a href="bene.htm">bene</a>ficial<br/>
effect on heart and mind.<br/>
<br/>
Art, in order to <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>elop, <a href="must.htm">must</a> be bound up with industry by a thousand<br/>
in<a href="term.htm">term</a>ediate degrees, blended, so to say, as Ruskin and the great<br/>
Socialist poet Morris have proved so often and so well. Every<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> that<br/>
surrounds man, in the street, in the interior and exterior of public<br/>
monuments, <a href="must.htm">must</a> be of a pure artistic form.<br/>
<br/>
But this can only be realized in a society in which all enjoy comfort<br/>
and leisure. Then only shall <a href="we.htm">we</a> see art associations, of which each<br/>
member will find room for his capacity; for art cannot dispense with an<br/>
infinity of purely manual and technical supplementary <a href="work.htm">work</a>s. These<br/>
artistic associations will undertake to embellish the houses of their<br/>
members, as those kind volunteers, the young painters of Edinburgh, did<br/>
in decorating the <a href="wall.htm">wall</a>s and ceilings of the great hospital for the poor<br/>
in their city.<br/>
<br/>
A painter or sculptor who has <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed a <a href="work.htm">work</a> of <a href="person.htm">person</a>al feeling will<br/>
offer it to the woman he loves, or to a friend. Executed for love's<br/>
sake,--will his <a href="work.htm">work</a>, inspired by love, be inferior to the art that<br/>
to-day satisfies the vanity of the philistine, because it has <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> much<br/>
<a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y?<br/>
<br/>
The same will be done as regards all pleasures not comprised in the<br/>
necessaries of life. He who wishes for a grand piano will enter the<br/>
association of <a href="music.htm">music</a>al <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>rument <a href="make.htm">make</a>rs. And by giving the association<br/>
part of his half-days' leisure, he will soon possess the piano of his<br/>
dreams. If he is fond of astronomical studies he will <a href="join.htm">join</a> the<br/>
association of astronomers, with its philosophers, its ob<a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ers, its<br/>
calculators, with its artists in astronomical <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ruments, its<br/>
scientists and amateurs, and he will have the telescope he desires by<br/>
taking his <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e of the associated <a href="work.htm">work</a>, for it is especially the rough<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a> that is <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed in an astronomical ob<a href="serv.htm">serv</a>atory--bricklayer's,<br/>
carpenter's, founder's, mechanic's <a href="work.htm">work</a>, the last touch being given to<br/>
the <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>rument of precision by the artist.<br/>
<br/>
In short, the five or seven hours a day which each will have at his<br/>
disposal, after having consecrated several hours to the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion of<br/>
necessities, would amply suffice to satisfy all longings for luxury,<br/>
however varied. Thousands of associations would undertake to supply<br/>
them. What is now the privilege of an insignificant minority would be<br/>
accessible to all. Luxury, ceasing to be a foolish and ostentatious<br/>
display of the bourgeois <a href="class.htm">class</a>, would become an artistic pleasure.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone would be the happier for it. In collective <a href="work.htm">work</a>, performed with<br/>
a light heart to attain a desired end, a book, a <a href="work.htm">work</a> of art, or an<br/>
<a href="object.htm">object</a> of luxury, each will find an incentive and the necessary<br/>
relaxation that <a href="make.htm">make</a>s life pleasant.<br/>
<br/>
In <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing to put an end to the division between master and slave, <a href="we.htm">we</a><br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a> for the happiness of <a href="bot.htm">bot</a>h, for the happiness of humanity.<br/>

CHAPTER X<br/>
<br/>
<a href="agree.htm">AGREE</a>ABLE <a href="work.htm">WORK</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I<br/>
<br/>
When Socialists maintain that a society, <a href="free.htm">free</a>d from the rule of the<br/>
<a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ists, would <a href="make.htm">make</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a> <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>able, and would suppress all repugnant<br/>
and un<a href="heal.htm">heal</a>thy drudgery, they are laughed at. And yet even to-day <a href="we.htm">we</a> can<br/>
see the striking progress that is being made in this direction; and<br/>
wherever this progress has been achieved, <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ers congratu<a href="late.htm">late</a><br/>
themselves on the <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy of energy obtained thereby.<br/>
<br/>
It is evident that a <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>y could be made as <a href="heal.htm">heal</a>thy and pleasant as a<br/>
scientific <a href="labor.htm">labor</a>atory. And it is no less evident that it would be<br/>
advantageous to <a href="make.htm">make</a> it so. In a spacious and well-venti<a href="late.htm">late</a>d <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>y<br/>
the <a href="work.htm">work</a> is better; it is easy to introduce many small ameliorations, of<br/>
which each represents an <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy of <a href="time.htm">time</a> or of manual labour. And if<br/>
most of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>shops <a href="we.htm">we</a> know are foul and un<a href="heal.htm">heal</a>thy, it is because the<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>ers are of no account in the <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization of <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies, and because<br/>
the most absurd waste of human energy is the distinctive feature of the<br/>
present industrial <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization.<br/>
<br/>
Ne<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>heless, now and again, <a href="we.htm">we</a> already find, even now, some <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies<br/>
so well managed that it would be a real pleasure to <a href="work.htm">work</a> in them, if the<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>, be it well understood, were not to last more than four or five<br/>
hours a day, and if every one had the possibility of varying it<br/>
according to his tastes.<br/>
<br/>
There are immense <a href="work.htm">work</a>s, which I know, in one of the Mid<a href="land.htm">land</a> counties,<br/>
unfortunately consecrated to engines of war. They are perfect as regards<br/>
<a href="sani.htm">sani</a>tary and intelligent <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization. They occupy fifty English acres<br/>
of <a href="land.htm">land</a>, fifteen of which are roofed with glass. The pavement of<br/>
fire-proof bricks is as <a href="clean.htm">clean</a> as that of a miner's cottage, and the<br/>
glass roof is carefully <a href="clean.htm">clean</a>ed by a gang of <a href="work.htm">work</a>men who do no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a><br/>
else. In these <a href="work.htm">work</a>s are forged steel ingots or blooms weighing as much<br/>
as twenty tons; and when you stand thirty feet from the immense furnace,<br/>
whose flames have a temperature of more than a thousand degrees, you do<br/>
not guess its presence save when its great doors <a href="open.htm">open</a> to let out a steel<br/>
monster. And the monster is handled by only three or four <a href="work.htm">work</a>men, who<br/>
now here, now there, <a href="open.htm">open</a> a tap causing immense cranes to move one way<br/>
or another by the pressure of <a href="water.htm">water</a>.<br/>
<br/>
You enter these <a href="work.htm">work</a>s expecting to hear the deafening noise of stampers,<br/>
and you find that there are no stampers. The immense hundred-ton guns<br/>
and the crank-shafts of <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>atlantic s<a href="team.htm">team</a>ers are forged by hydraulic<br/>
pressure, and the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er has but to turn a tap to give shape to the<br/>
immense mass of steel, which <a href="make.htm">make</a>s a far more homogeneous <a href="meta.htm">meta</a>l, without<br/>
crack or flaw, of the blooms, whatever be their thickness.<br/>
<br/>
I expected an infernal grating, and I saw machines which cut b<a href="lock.htm">lock</a>s of<br/>
steel thirty feet long with no more noise than is <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed to cut cheese.<br/>
And when I expressed my admiration to the engineer who showed <a href="us.htm">us</a> round,<br/>
he answered--<br/>
<br/>
"A mere question of <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy! This machine, that <a href="plan.htm">plan</a>es steel, has been<br/>
in <a href="use.htm">use</a> for forty-two years. It would not have lasted ten years if its<br/>
parts, badly adjusted, 'interfered' and creaked at each movement of the<br/>
<a href="plan.htm">plan</a>e!<br/>
<br/>
"And the blast-furnaces? It would be a waste to let heat escape <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ead<br/>
of utilizing it. Why roast the founders, when heat lost by radiation<br/>
represents tons of coal?<br/>
<br/>
"The stampers that made buildings shake five leagues off were also<br/>
waste. Is it not better to forge by pressure than by impact, and it<br/>
<a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s less--there is less loss.<br/>
<br/>
"In these <a href="work.htm">work</a>s, light, <a href="clean.htm">clean</a>liness, the space allotted to each bench,<br/>
are but a simple question of <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy. <a href="work.htm">Work</a> is better done when you can<br/>
see what you do, and have elbow-room.<br/>
<br/>
"It is true," he said, "<a href="we.htm">we</a> were very cramped before coming here. <a href="land.htm">Land</a><br/>
is so expensive in the vicinity of large towns--<a href="land.htm">land</a>lords are so<br/>
grasping!"<br/>
<br/>
It is even so in mines. <a href="we.htm">We</a> know what mines are like nowadays from Zola's<br/>
descriptions and from <a href="new.htm">new</a>spaper re<a href="port.htm">port</a>s. But the mine of the <a href="future.htm">future</a> will<br/>
be well venti<a href="late.htm">late</a>d, with a temperature as easily regu<a href="late.htm">late</a>d as that of a<br/>
library; there will be no horses doomed to die below the earth:<br/>
underground traction will be carried on by <a href="means.htm">means</a> of an <a href="auto.htm">auto</a>matic cable<br/>
put into motion at the pit's mouth. Ventilators will be always <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing,<br/>
and there will never be explosions. This is no dream, such a mine is<br/>
already to be seen in Eng<a href="land.htm">land</a>; I went down it. Here again the ex<a href="cell.htm">cell</a>ent<br/>
<a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization is simply a question of <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy. The mine of which I speak,<br/>
in spite of its immense depth <small>(466 yards)</small>, has an <a href="output.htm">output</a> of a thousand<br/>
tons of coal a day, with only two hundred miners--five tons a day per<br/>
each <a href="work.htm">work</a>er, whereas the average for the two thousand pits in Eng<a href="land.htm">land</a> at<br/>
the <a href="time.htm">time</a> I visited this mine in the <a href="early.htm">early</a> 'nineties, was hardly three<br/>
hundred tons a year per man.<br/>
<br/>
If necessary, it would be easy to multiply examples proving that as<br/>
regards the <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ial <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization Fourier's dream was not a Utopia.<br/>
<br/>
This question has, however, been so frequently discussed in Socialist<br/>
<a href="new.htm">new</a>spapers that public opinion should already be educated on this <a href="point.htm">point</a>.<br/>
<a href="factor.htm">Factor</a>y, forge and mine _can_ be as <a href="heal.htm">heal</a>thy and magnificent as the<br/>
finest <a href="labor.htm">labor</a>atories in <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern universities, and the better the<br/>
<a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization the more will man's labour <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
If it be so, can <a href="we.htm">we</a> doubt that <a href="work.htm">work</a> will become a pleasure and a<br/>
relaxation in a society of equals, in which "hands" will not be<br/>
compelled to <a href="sell.htm">sell</a> themselves to toil, and to accept <a href="work.htm">work</a> under any<br/>
conditions? Repugnant tasks will disappear, because it is evident that<br/>
these un<a href="heal.htm">heal</a>thy conditions are harmful to society as a whole. Slaves can<br/>
submit to them, but <a href="free.htm">free</a> men will <a href="creat.htm">creat</a>e <a href="new.htm">new</a> conditions, and their <a href="work.htm">work</a><br/>
will be pleasant and infinitely more <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive. The exceptions of<br/>
to-day will be the rule of to-morrow.<br/>
<br/>
The same will come to <a href="pass.htm">pass</a> as regards domestic <a href="work.htm">work</a>, which to-day<br/>
society lays on the shoulders of that drudge of humanity--woman.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
II<br/>
<br/>
A society regenerated by the Revolution will <a href="make.htm">make</a> domestic slavery<br/>
disappear--this last form of slavery, perhaps the most tenacious,<br/>
because it is also the most ancient. Only it will not come about in the<br/>
way dreamt of by Phalansterians, nor in the manner often imagined by<br/>
authoritarian <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ists.<br/>
<br/>
Phalansteries are repugnant to millions of human beings. The most<br/>
re<a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ed man certainly feels the necessity of meeting his fellows for<br/>
the purpose of <a href="common.htm">common</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a>, which becomes the more attractive the more<br/>
he feels himself a part of an immense whole. But it is not so for the<br/>
hours of leisure, re<a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ed for rest and intimacy. The phalanstery and<br/>
the familystery do not take this into account, or else they endeavour to<br/>
supply this <a href="need.htm">need</a> by artificial <a href="group.htm">group</a>ings.<br/>
<br/>
A phalanstery, which is in fact no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> but an immense hotel, can please<br/>
some, and even all at a certain period of their life, but the great mass<br/>
prefers family life <small>(family life of the <a href="future.htm">future</a>, be it understood)</small>. They<br/>
prefer iso<a href="late.htm">late</a>d apartments, Anglo-Saxons even going as far as to prefer<br/>
houses of from six to eight rooms, in which the family, or an<br/>
agglomeration of friends, can live apart. Some<a href="time.htm">time</a>s a phalanstery is a<br/>
necessity, but it would be hateful, were it the general rule. Isolation,<br/>
alternating with <a href="time.htm">time</a> spent in society, is the normal desire of human<br/>
nature. This is why one of the greatest tortures in prison is the<br/>
impossibility of isolation, much as solitary confinement becomes torture<br/>
in its turn, when not alternated with hours of social life.<br/>
<br/>
As to considerations of <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy, which are some<a href="time.htm">time</a>s laid stress on in<br/>
favour of phalansteries, they are those of a petty <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>esman. The most<br/>
im<a href="port.htm">port</a>ant <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy, the only reasonable one, is to <a href="make.htm">make</a> life pleasant for<br/>
all, because the man who is satisfied with his life <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>es infinitely<br/>
more than the man who <a href="cur.htm">cur</a>ses his surroundings.<small>[8]</small><br/>
<br/>
Other Socialists reject the phalanstery. But when you ask them how<br/>
domestic <a href="work.htm">work</a> can be <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nized, they answer: "Each can do 'his <a href="own.htm">own</a><br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>.' My wife manages the house; the wives of bourgeois will do as<br/>
much." And if it is a bourgeois playing at Socialism who speaks, he will<br/>
add, with a gracious smile to his wife: "Is it not true, darling, that<br/>
you would do without a <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ant in the Socialist society? You would <a href="work.htm">work</a><br/>
like the wife of <a href="our.htm">our</a> <a href="good.htm">good</a> comrade Paul or the wife of John the<br/>
carpenter?"<br/>
<br/>
<a href="serv.htm">Serv</a>ant or wife, man always reckons on woman to do the house-<a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
But woman, too, at last claims her <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e in the emancipation of<br/>
humanity. She no longer <a href="want.htm">want</a>s to be the beast of burden of the house.<br/>
She considers it sufficient <a href="work.htm">work</a> to give many years of her life to the<br/>
rearing of her children. She no longer <a href="want.htm">want</a>s to be the cook, the mender,<br/>
the sweeper of the house! And, owing to American women taking the lead<br/>
in obtaining their claims, there is a general complaint of the dearth of<br/>
women who will condescend to domestic <a href="work.htm">work</a> in the United States. My lady<br/>
prefers art, politics, literature, or the gaming tables; as to the<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>-girls, they are few, those who consent to submit to apron-slavery,<br/>
and <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ants are only found with difficulty in the States. Consequently,<br/>
the <a href="solu.htm">solu</a>tion, a very simple one, is <a href="point.htm">point</a>ed out by life itself.<br/>
Machinery undertakes three-quarters of the house<a href="hold.htm">hold</a> cares.<br/>
<br/>
You black your boots, and you know how ridiculous this <a href="work.htm">work</a> is. What can<br/>
be more stupid than rubbing a boot twenty or thirty <a href="time.htm">time</a>s with a brush?<br/>
A tenth of the European population <a href="must.htm">must</a> be compelled to <a href="sell.htm">sell</a> itself in<br/>
<a href="exch.htm">exch</a>ange for a miserable <a href="shelter.htm">shelter</a> and insufficient <a href="food.htm">food</a>, and woman <a href="must.htm">must</a><br/>
consider herself a slave, in order that millions of her sex should go<br/>
through this performance every morning.<br/>
<br/>
But hairdressers have already machines for brushing glossy or woolly<br/>
heads of hair. Why should <a href="we.htm">we</a> not apply, then, the same principle to the<br/>
other extremity? So it has been done, and nowadays the machine for<br/>
blacking boots is in general <a href="use.htm">use</a> in big American and European hotels.<br/>
Its <a href="use.htm">use</a> is spreading outside hotels. In large English schools, where the<br/>
pupils are boarding in the houses of the teachers, it has been found<br/>
easier to have one single establishment which undertakes to brush a<br/>
thousand pairs of boots every morning.<br/>
<br/>
As to <a href="wash.htm">wash</a>ing up! Where can <a href="we.htm">we</a> find a housewife who has not a horror of<br/>
this long and dirty <a href="work.htm">work</a>, that is usually done by hand, solely because<br/>
the <a href="work.htm">work</a> of the domestic slave is of no account.<br/>
<br/>
In America they do better. There are already a number of cities in which<br/>
hot <a href="water.htm">water</a> is conveyed to the houses as cold <a href="water.htm">water</a> is in Europe. Under<br/>
these conditions the problem was a simple one, and a woman--Mrs.<br/>
Cochrane--<a href="solv.htm">solv</a>ed it. Her machine <a href="wash.htm">wash</a>es twelve dozen p<a href="late.htm">late</a>s or dishes,<br/>
wipes them and dries them, in less than three minutes. A <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>y in<br/>
Illinois manufactures these machines and <a href="sell.htm">sell</a>s them at a <a href="price.htm">price</a> within<br/>
reach of the average middle-<a href="class.htm">class</a> purse. And why should not small<br/>
house<a href="hold.htm">hold</a>s send their crockery to an establishment as well as their<br/>
boots? It is even probable that the two functions, brushing and <a href="wash.htm">wash</a>ing<br/>
up, will be undertaken by the same association.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="clean.htm">Clean</a>ing, rubbing the skin off your hands when <a href="wash.htm">wash</a>ing and wringing<br/>
linen; sweeping floors and brushing carpets, thereby raising clouds of<br/>
dust which afterwards occasion much trouble to dislodge from the places<br/>
where they have settled down, all this <a href="work.htm">work</a> is still done because woman<br/>
remains a slave, but it tends to disappear as it can be infinitely<br/>
better done by machinery. Machines of all kinds will be introduced into<br/>
house<a href="hold.htm">hold</a>s, and the distribution of motor-power in private houses will<br/>
enable people to <a href="work.htm">work</a> them without muscular effort.<br/>
<br/>
Such machines <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> little to manufacture. If <a href="we.htm">we</a> still <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> very much for<br/>
them, it is because they are not in general <a href="use.htm">use</a>, and chiefly because an<br/>
exorbitant <a href="tax.htm">tax</a> is levied upon every machine by the gentlemen who wish to<br/>
live in grand style and who have specu<a href="late.htm">late</a>d on <a href="land.htm">land</a>, raw <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ial,<br/>
manufacture, sale, patents, and duties.<br/>
<br/>
But emancipation from domestic toil will not be brought about by small<br/>
machines only. House<a href="hold.htm">hold</a>s are emerging from their present state of<br/>
isolation; they begin to associate with other house<a href="hold.htm">hold</a>s to do in <a href="common.htm">common</a><br/>
what they did separately.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, in the <a href="future.htm">future</a> <a href="we.htm">we</a> shall not have a brushing machine, a machine<br/>
for <a href="wash.htm">wash</a>ing up p<a href="late.htm">late</a>s, a third for <a href="wash.htm">wash</a>ing linen, and so on, in each<br/>
house. To the <a href="future.htm">future</a>, on the contrary, belongs the <a href="common.htm">common</a> heating<br/>
apparatus that sends heat into each room of a whole district and spares<br/>
the lighting of fires. It is already so in a few American cities. A<br/>
great central furnace supplies all houses and all rooms with hot <a href="water.htm">water</a>,<br/>
which circu<a href="late.htm">late</a>s in pipes; and to regu<a href="late.htm">late</a> the temperature you <a href="need.htm">need</a> only<br/>
turn a tap. And should you care to have a blazing fire in any particular<br/>
room you can light the gas specially supplied for heating purposes from<br/>
a central re<a href="serv.htm">serv</a>oir. All the immense <a href="work.htm">work</a> of <a href="clean.htm">clean</a>ing chimneys and<br/>
keeping up fires--and woman knows what <a href="time.htm">time</a> it takes--is disappearing.<br/>
<br/>
Candles, lamps, and even gas have had their day. There are entire cities<br/>
in which it is sufficient to press a button for light to burst forth,<br/>
and, indeed, it is a simple question of <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy and of knowledge to give<br/>
yourself the luxury of electric light. And lastly, also in America, they<br/>
speak of forming societies for the almost complete suppression of<br/>
house<a href="hold.htm">hold</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a>. It would only be necessary to <a href="creat.htm">creat</a>e a department for<br/>
every b<a href="lock.htm">lock</a> of houses. A cart would come to each door and take the boots<br/>
to be blacked, the crockery to be <a href="wash.htm">wash</a>ed up, the linen to be <a href="wash.htm">wash</a>ed, the<br/>
small <a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s to be mended <small>(if it were <a href="worth.htm">worth</a> while)</small>, the carpets to be<br/>
brushed, and the next morning would bring back the <a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s entrusted to<br/>
it, all well <a href="clean.htm">clean</a>ed. A few hours <a href="late.htm">late</a>r your hot coffee and your eggs<br/>
done to a nicety would appear on your table. It is a fact that between<br/>
twelve and two o'c<a href="lock.htm">lock</a> there are more than twenty million Americans and<br/>
as many Englishmen who <a href="eat.htm">eat</a> roast beef or mutton, boiled pork, potatoes<br/>
and a seasonable vegetable. And at the lowest figure eight million fires<br/>
burn during two or three hours to roast this meat and cook these<br/>
vegetables; eight million women spend their <a href="time.htm">time</a> preparing a meal which,<br/>
taking all house<a href="hold.htm">hold</a>s, represents at most a dozen diffe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> dishes.<br/>
<br/>
"Fifty fires burn," wrote an American woman the other day, "where one<br/>
would suffice!" Dine at home, at your <a href="own.htm">own</a> table, with your children, if<br/>
you like; but only think yourself, why should these fifty women waste<br/>
their whole morning to prepare a few cups of coffee and a simple meal!<br/>
Why fifty fires, when two people and one single fire would suffice to<br/>
cook all these pieces of meat and all these vegetables? Choose your <a href="own.htm">own</a><br/>
beef or mutton to be roasted if you are particular. Season the<br/>
vegetables to your taste if you prefer a particular sauce! But have a<br/>
single kitchen with a single fire and <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nize it as beautifully as you<br/>
are able to.<br/>
<br/>
Why has woman's <a href="work.htm">work</a> never been of any account? Why in every family are<br/>
the mother and three or four <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ants obliged to spend so much <a href="time.htm">time</a> at<br/>
what pertains to cooking? Because those who <a href="want.htm">want</a> to emancipate mankind<br/>
have not included woman in their dream of emancipation, and consider it<br/>
<a href="bene.htm">bene</a>ath their superior masculine dignity to think "of those kitchen<br/>
arrangements," which they have put on the shoulders of that<br/>
drudge--woman.<br/>
<br/>
To emancipate woman, is not only to <a href="open.htm">open</a> the gates of the university,<br/>
the <a href="law.htm">law</a> courts, or the parliaments to her, for the "emancipated" woman<br/>
will always throw her domestic toil on to another woman. To emancipate<br/>
woman is to <a href="free.htm">free</a> her from the brutalizing toil of kitchen and <a href="wash.htm">wash</a>house;<br/>
it is to <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nize your house<a href="hold.htm">hold</a> in such a way as to enable her to rear<br/>
her children, if she be so minded, while still retaining sufficient<br/>
leisure to take her <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e of social life.<br/>
<br/>
It will come. As <a href="we.htm">we</a> have said, <a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s are already improving. Only let <a href="us.htm">us</a><br/>
fully understand that a revolution, intoxicated with the beautiful<br/>
<a href="word.htm">word</a>s, Liberty, Equality, Solidarity, would not be a revolution if it<br/>
maintained slavery at home. Half humanity subjected to the slavery of<br/>
the hearth would still have to rebel aga<a href="inst.htm">inst</a> the other half.<br/>

<br/>
I<br/>
<br/>
Ac<a href="cust.htm">cust</a>omed as <a href="we.htm">we</a> are by heredity prejudices and <a href="our.htm">our</a> unsound education<br/>
and training to represent <a href="our.htm">our</a>selves the <a href="bene.htm">bene</a>ficial hand of Government,<br/>
legislation and magistracy everywhere, <a href="we.htm">we</a> have come to believe that man<br/>
would tear his fellow-man to pieces like a wild beast the day the police<br/>
took his eye off him; that ab<a href="solu.htm">solu</a>te chaos would come about if authority<br/>
were o<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>hrown during a revolution. And with <a href="our.htm">our</a> eyes shut <a href="we.htm">we</a> <a href="pass.htm">pass</a> by<br/>
thousands and thousands of human <a href="group.htm">group</a>ings which form themselves <a href="free.htm">free</a>ly,<br/>
without any intervention of the <a href="law.htm">law</a>, and attain results infinitely<br/>
superior to those achieved under governmental tutelage.<br/>
<br/>
If you <a href="open.htm">open</a> a daily paper you find that its pages are entirely <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>oted<br/>
to Government <a href="trans.htm">trans</a><a href="act.htm">act</a>ions and to political jobbery. A man from another<br/>
world, reading it, would believe that, with the exception of the Stock<br/>
<a href="exch.htm">Exch</a>ange <a href="trans.htm">trans</a><a href="act.htm">act</a>ions, no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> gets done in Europe save by order of some<br/>
master. You find no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> in the paper about <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>itutions that spring up,<br/>
<a href="grow.htm">grow</a> up, and <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>elop without ministerial prescription! No<a href="thing.htm">thing</a>--or<br/>
almost no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a>! Even where there is a heading, "<a href="sun.htm">Sun</a>dry Events" <small>(_Faits<br/>
divers_, a favorite column in the French papers)</small>, it is because they are<br/>
connected with the police. A family drama, an <a href="act.htm">act</a> of rebellion, will<br/>
only be mentioned if the police have appeared on the scene.<br/>
<br/>
Three hundred and fifty million Europeans love or hate one another,<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>, or live on their incomes; but, apart from literature, theatre, or<br/>
s<a href="port.htm">port</a>, their lives remain ignored by <a href="new.htm">new</a>spapers if Governments have not<br/>
intervened in it in some way or other. It is even so with history. <a href="we.htm">We</a><br/>
know the least details of the life of a king or of a parliament; all<br/>
<a href="good.htm">good</a> and bad speeches pronounced by the politicians have been pre<a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ed:<br/>
"speeches that have never had the least influence on the vote of a<br/>
single member," as an <a href="old.htm">old</a> parliamentarian said. Royal visits, the <a href="good.htm">good</a><br/>
or bad humour of politicians, their jokes and intrigues, are all<br/>
carefully recorded for posterity. But <a href="we.htm">we</a> have the greatest difficulty to<br/>
r<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>stitute a city of the Middle Ages, to understand the mechanism of<br/>
that immense <a href="commer.htm">commer</a>ce that was carried on between Hanseatic cities, or<br/>
to know how the city of Rouen built its cathedral. If a scholar spends<br/>
his life in studying these questions, his <a href="work.htm">work</a>s remain unknown, and<br/>
parliamentary histories--that is to say, the defective ones, as they<br/>
only treat of one side of social life--multiply; they are circu<a href="late.htm">late</a>d,<br/>
they are taught in schools.<br/>
<br/>
In this way <a href="we.htm">we</a> do not even perceive the prodigious <a href="work.htm">work</a>, accomplished<br/>
every day by spontaneous <a href="group.htm">group</a>s of men, which constitutes the chief <a href="work.htm">work</a><br/>
of <a href="our.htm">our</a> century.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> therefore propose to <a href="point.htm">point</a> out some of these most striking<br/>
manifestations, and to show how men, as soon as their <a href="interest.htm">interest</a>s do not<br/>
ab<a href="solu.htm">solu</a>tely clash, <a href="act.htm">act</a> in concert, harmoniously, and perform collective<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a> of a very complex nature.<br/>
<br/>
It is evident that in present society, based on individual<br/>
<a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty--that is to say, on plunder, and on a narrow-minded, and<br/>
therefore foolish individualism--facts of this kind are necessarily<br/>
limited; <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ments are not always perfectly <a href="free.htm">free</a>, and often they have a<br/>
mean, if not execrable aim.<br/>
<br/>
But what concerns <a href="us.htm">us</a> is not to give examples which might be blindly<br/>
followed, and which, moreover, present society could not possibly give<br/>
<a href="us.htm">us</a>. What <a href="we.htm">we</a> have to do is to show that, in spite of the authoritarian<br/>
individualism which stifles <a href="us.htm">us</a>, there remains in <a href="our.htm">our</a> life, taken as a<br/>
whole, a very great part in which <a href="we.htm">we</a> only <a href="act.htm">act</a> by <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment; and<br/>
that therefore it would be much easier than is usually thought, to<br/>
dispense with Government.<br/>
<br/>
In sup<a href="port.htm">port</a> of <a href="our.htm">our</a> view <a href="we.htm">we</a> have already mentioned railways, and <a href="we.htm">we</a> will<br/>
now <a href="return.htm">return</a> to them.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> know that Europe has a system of railways, over 175,000 miles long,<br/>
and that on this net<a href="work.htm">work</a> you can nowadays travel from north to south,<br/>
from east to west, from Madrid to Petersburg, and from Calais to<br/>
Constantinople, without delays, without even <a href="chang.htm">chang</a>ing carriages <small>(when<br/>
you travel by express)</small>. More than that: a parcel deposited at a station<br/>
will find its addressee anywhere, in Turkey or in Central Asia, without<br/>
more formality <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed for sending it than writing its destination on a<br/>
bit of paper.<br/>
<br/>
This result might have been obtained in two ways. A Napoleon, a<br/>
Bismarck, or some <a href="potent.htm">potent</a>ate having conquered Europe, would from Paris,<br/>
Berlin, or Rome, draw a railway map and regu<a href="late.htm">late</a> the hours of the<br/>
trains. The Russian Tsar Nicholas I. dreamt of such a power. When he was<br/>
shown rough drafts of railways between Moscow and Petersburg, he seized<br/>
a ruler and drew on the map of Russia a straight line between these two<br/>
<a href="capital.htm">capital</a>s, saying, "Here is the <a href="plan.htm">plan</a>." And the road was built in a<br/>
straight line, filling in deep ravines, building bridges of a giddy<br/>
height, which had to be abandoned a few years <a href="late.htm">late</a>r, after the railway<br/>
had <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> about £120,000 to £150,000 per English mile.<br/>
<br/>
This is one way, but happily <a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s were managed diffe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ly. Railways<br/>
were constructed piece by piece, the pieces were <a href="join.htm">join</a>ed together, and<br/>
the hundred diffe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> companies, to whom these pieces belonged,<br/>
gradually came to an understanding concerning the arrival and departure<br/>
of their trains, and the running of carriages on their rails, from all<br/>
countries, without unloading merchandise as it <a href="pass.htm">pass</a>es from one net<a href="work.htm">work</a><br/>
to another.<br/>
<br/>
All this was done by <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment, by <a href="exch.htm">exch</a>ange of letters and<br/>
proposals, and by congresses at which delegates met to discuss well<br/>
specified special <a href="point.htm">point</a>s, and to come to an <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment about them, but<br/>
not to <a href="make.htm">make</a> <a href="law.htm">law</a>s. After the congress was over, the delegates <a href="return.htm">return</a>ed to<br/>
their respective companies, not with a <a href="law.htm">law</a>, but with the draft of a<br/>
contract to be accepted or rejected.<br/>
<br/>
Of course difficulties were met in the way. There were obstinate men<br/>
who would not be convinced. But a <a href="common.htm">common</a> <a href="interest.htm">interest</a> compelled them to<br/>
<a href="agree.htm">agree</a> in the end, without invoking the help of armies aga<a href="inst.htm">inst</a> the<br/>
refractory members.<br/>
<br/>
This immense net<a href="work.htm">work</a> of railways connected together, and the enormous<br/>
traffic it has given rise to, no doubt constitutes the most striking<br/>
trait of the nineteenth century; and it is the result of <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment.<br/>
If somebody had foretold it eighty years ago, <a href="our.htm">our</a> grandfathers would<br/>
have thought him idiotic or mad. They would have said: "Never will you<br/>
be able to <a href="make.htm">make</a> the <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e<a href="hold.htm">hold</a>ers of a hundred companies listen to<br/>
reason! It is a Utopia, a fairy tale. A central Government, with an<br/>
'iron' dictator, can alone enforce it."<br/>
<br/>
And the most <a href="interest.htm">interest</a>ing <a href="thing.htm">thing</a> in this <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization is, that there is no<br/>
European Central Government of Railways! No<a href="thing.htm">thing</a>! No minister of<br/>
railways, no dictator, not even a continental parliament, not even a<br/>
directing <a href="commit.htm">commit</a>tee! Every<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> is done by <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment.<br/>
<br/>
So <a href="we.htm">we</a> ask the believers in the State, who pretend that "<a href="we.htm">we</a> can never do<br/>
without a central Government, were it only for regulating the traffic,"<br/>
<a href="we.htm">we</a> ask them: "But how do European railways manage without them? How do<br/>
they continue to convey millions of travellers and mountains of luggage<br/>
a<a href="cross.htm">cross</a> a continent? If companies <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing railways have been able to<br/>
<a href="agree.htm">agree</a>, why should railway <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers, who would take possession of<br/>
railways, not <a href="agree.htm">agree</a> likewise? And if the Petersburg-Warsaw Company and<br/>
that of Paris-Belfort can <a href="act.htm">act</a> in harmony, without giving themselves the<br/>
luxury of a <a href="common.htm">common</a> commander, why, in the midst of <a href="our.htm">our</a> societies,<br/>
consisting of <a href="group.htm">group</a>s of <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers, should <a href="we.htm">we</a> <a href="need.htm">need</a> a Government?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
II<br/>
<br/>
When <a href="we.htm">we</a> endeavour to prove by examples that even to-day, in spite of the<br/>
iniquitous <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization of society as a whole, men, provided their<br/>
<a href="interest.htm">interest</a>s be not diametrically opposed, <a href="agree.htm">agree</a> without the intervention<br/>
of authority, <a href="we.htm">we</a> do not ignore the <a href="object.htm">object</a>ions that will be put forth.<br/>
<br/>
All such examples have their defective side, because it is impossible<br/>
to quote a single <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization exempt from the exploitation of the weak<br/>
by the strong, the poor by the rich. This is why the Statists will not<br/>
fail to tell <a href="us.htm">us</a> with their wonted logic: "You see that the intervention<br/>
of the State is necessary to put an end to this exploitation!"<br/>
<br/>
Only they forget the lessons of history; they do not tell <a href="us.htm">us</a> to what<br/>
extent the State itself has contributed towards the existing order by<br/>
<a href="creat.htm">creat</a>ing proletarians and delivering them up to exploiters. They forget<br/>
to prove <a href="us.htm">us</a> that it is possible to put an end to exploitation while the<br/>
primal causes--private <a href="capital.htm">capital</a> and po<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>y, two-thirds of which are<br/>
artificially <a href="creat.htm">creat</a>ed by the State--continue to exist.<br/>
<br/>
When <a href="we.htm">we</a> speak of the accord established among the railway companies, <a href="we.htm">we</a><br/>
expect them, the worshippers of the bourgeois State, to say to <a href="us.htm">us</a>: "Do<br/>
you not see how the railway companies oppress and ill-<a href="use.htm">use</a> their<br/>
<a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ees and the travellers! The only way is, that the State should<br/>
intervene to <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers and the public!"<br/>
<br/>
But have <a href="we.htm">we</a> not said and repeated over and over again, that as long as<br/>
there are <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ists, these abuses of power will be perpetuated? It is<br/>
precisely the State, the would-be <a href="bene.htm">bene</a><a href="factor.htm">factor</a>, that has given to the<br/>
companies that monopoly and those rights upon <a href="us.htm">us</a> which they possess<br/>
to-day. Has it not <a href="creat.htm">creat</a>ed concessions, guarantees? Has it not sent its<br/>
<a href="sold.htm">sold</a>iers aga<a href="inst.htm">inst</a> railwaymen on strike? And during the first trials<br/>
<small>(quite <a href="late.htm">late</a>ly <a href="we.htm">we</a> saw it still in Russia)</small>, has it not extended the<br/>
privilege of the railway magnates as far as to forbid the Press to<br/>
mention railway accidents, so as not to depreciate the <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>es it<br/>
guaranteed? Has it not favoured the monopoly which has anointed the<br/>
Vanderbilts and the Polyakoffs, the directors of the P.L.M., the C.P.R.,<br/>
the St. Gothard, "the kings of <a href="our.htm">our</a> days"?<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, if <a href="we.htm">we</a> give as an example the tacit <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment come to between<br/>
railway companies, it is by no <a href="means.htm">means</a> as an ideal of <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omical<br/>
management, nor even an ideal of technical <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization. It is to show<br/>
that if <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ists, without any other aim than that of augmenting<br/>
their dividends at other people's expense, can exploit railways<br/>
successfully without establishing an International<br/>
Department,--societies of <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing men will be able to do it just as<br/>
well, and even better, without nominating a Ministry of European<br/>
railways.<br/>
<br/>
Another <a href="object.htm">object</a>ion is raised that is more serious at first sight. <a href="we.htm">We</a> may<br/>
be told that the <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment <a href="we.htm">we</a> speak of is not perfectly _<a href="free.htm">free</a>_, that the<br/>
large companies lay down the <a href="law.htm">law</a> to the small ones. It might be<br/>
mentioned, for example, that a certain rich German company, sup<a href="port.htm">port</a>ed by<br/>
the State, compel travellers who go from Berlin to Bâle to <a href="pass.htm">pass</a> via<br/>
Cologne and Frankfort, <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ead of taking the Leipzig route; or that such<br/>
a company carries <a href="good.htm">good</a>s a hundred and thirty miles in a roundabout way<br/>
<small>(on a long distance)</small> to favour its influential <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e<a href="hold.htm">hold</a>ers, and thus<br/>
ruins the s<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>dary lines. In the United States travellers and <a href="good.htm">good</a>s are<br/>
some<a href="time.htm">time</a>s compelled to travel impossibly circuitous routes so that<br/>
dollars may flow into the pocket of a Vanderbilt.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="our.htm">Our</a> answer will be the same: As long as <a href="capital.htm">Capital</a> exists, the Greater<br/>
<a href="capital.htm">Capital</a> will oppress the lesser. But oppression does not result from<br/>
<a href="capital.htm">Capital</a> only. It is also owing to the sup<a href="port.htm">port</a> given them by the State,<br/>
to monopoly <a href="creat.htm">creat</a>ed by the State in their favour, that the large<br/>
companies oppress the small ones.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="early.htm">early</a> English and French Socialists have shown long since how<br/>
English legislation did all in its power to ruin the small industries,<br/>
drive the peasant to po<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>y, and deliver over to wealthy industrial<br/>
<a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ers battalions of men, compelled to <a href="work.htm">work</a> for no <a href="matt.htm">matt</a>er what<br/>
salary. Railway legislation did exactly the same. Strategic lines,<br/>
subsidized lines, companies which received the International Mail<br/>
monopoly, every<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> was brought into play to forward the <a href="interest.htm">interest</a>s of<br/>
wealthy financiers. When <a href="rot.htm">Rot</a>hschild, creditor to all European States,<br/>
puts <a href="capital.htm">capital</a> in a railway, his faithful subjects, the ministers, will do<br/>
their best to <a href="make.htm">make</a> him earn more.<br/>
<br/>
In the United States, in the Democracy that authoritarians <a href="hold.htm">hold</a> up to <a href="us.htm">us</a><br/>
as an ideal, the most scandalous fraudulency has crept into every<a href="thing.htm">thing</a><br/>
that concerns railroads. Thus, if a company ruins its competitors by<br/>
cheap fares, it is often enabled to do so because it is reimbursed by<br/>
<a href="land.htm">land</a> given to it by the State for a gratuity. Documents recently<br/>
published concerning the American wheat <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e have fully shown up the<br/>
part played by the State in the exploitation of the weak by the strong.<br/>
Here, too, the power of accumu<a href="late.htm">late</a>d <a href="capital.htm">capital</a> has increased tenfold and a<br/>
hundredfold by <a href="means.htm">means</a> of State help. So that, when <a href="we.htm">we</a> see syndicates of<br/>
railway companies <small>(a <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t of <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment)</small> succeeding in <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ing<br/>
their small companies aga<a href="inst.htm">inst</a> big ones, <a href="we.htm">we</a> are astonished at the<br/>
intrinsic force of <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment that can <a href="hold.htm">hold</a> its <a href="own.htm">own</a> aga<a href="inst.htm">inst</a><br/>
all-powerful <a href="capital.htm">Capital</a> favoured by the State.<br/>
<br/>
It is a fact that little companies exist, in spite of the State's<br/>
partiality. If in France, <a href="land.htm">land</a> of centralization, <a href="we.htm">we</a> only see five or<br/>
six large companies, there are more than a hundred and ten in Great<br/>
Britain who <a href="agree.htm">agree</a> remarkably well, and who are certainly better<br/>
<a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nized for the rapid <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>it of travellers and <a href="good.htm">good</a>s than the French<br/>
and German companies.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, that is not the question. Large <a href="capital.htm">Capital</a>, favoured by the<br/>
State, can always, _if it be to its advantage_, crush the lesser one.<br/>
What is of im<a href="port.htm">port</a>ance to <a href="us.htm">us</a> is this: The <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment between hundreds of<br/>
<a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ist companies to whom the railways of Europe belong, _was<br/>
established without intervention of a central government_ to lay down<br/>
the <a href="law.htm">law</a> to the divers societies; it has subsisted by <a href="means.htm">means</a> of congresses<br/>
composed of delegates, who discuss among themselves, and submit<br/>
_proposals_, not _<a href="law.htm">law</a>s_, to their constituents. It is a <a href="new.htm">new</a> principle<br/>
that differs completely from all governmental principle, monarchical or<br/>
republican, ab<a href="solu.htm">solu</a>te or parliamentarian. It is an innovation that has<br/>
been timidly introduced into the <a href="cust.htm">cust</a>oms of Europe, but has come to<br/>
stay.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
III<br/>
<br/>
How often have <a href="we.htm">we</a> not read in the writings of State-loving Socialists:<br/>
"Who, then, will undertake the regulation of canal traffic in the<br/>
<a href="future.htm">future</a> society? Should it enter the mind of one of your Anarchist<br/>
'comrades' to put his barge a<a href="cross.htm">cross</a> a canal and obstruct thousands of<br/>
boats, who will force him to reason?"<br/>
<br/>
Let <a href="us.htm">us</a> confess the supposition to be somewhat fanciful. Still, it might<br/>
be said, for <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ance: "Should a certain <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>e, or a <a href="group.htm">group</a> of<br/>
<a href="commun.htm">commun</a>es, <a href="want.htm">want</a> to <a href="make.htm">make</a> their barges <a href="pass.htm">pass</a> before others, they might<br/>
perhaps b<a href="lock.htm">lock</a> the canal in order to <a href="carry.htm">carry</a> stones, while wheat, <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed in<br/>
another <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>e, would have to stand by. Who, then, would regu<a href="late.htm">late</a> the<br/>
traffic if not the Government?"<br/>
<br/>
But real life has again demonstrated that Government can be very well<br/>
dispensed with here as elsewhere. <a href="free.htm">Free</a> <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment, <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization,<br/>
replace that noxious and <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>ly system, and do better.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> know what canals mean to Hol<a href="land.htm">land</a>. They are its highways. <a href="we.htm">We</a> also<br/>
know how much traffic there is on the canals. What is carried along <a href="our.htm">our</a><br/>
highroads and railroads is <a href="trans.htm">trans</a><a href="port.htm">port</a>ed on canal-boats in Hol<a href="land.htm">land</a>. There<br/>
you could find cause to fight, in order to <a href="make.htm">make</a> your boats <a href="pass.htm">pass</a> before<br/>
others. There the Government might really interfere to keep the traffic<br/>
in order.<br/>
<br/>
Yet it is not so. The Dutch settled <a href="matt.htm">matt</a>ers in a more practical way,<br/>
long ago, by founding guilds, or syndicates of boatmen. These were <a href="free.htm">free</a><br/>
associations sprung from the very <a href="need.htm">need</a>s of navigation. The right of way<br/>
for the boats was adjusted by the order of inscription in a navigation<br/>
register; they had to follow one another in turn. Nobody was allowed to<br/>
get ahead of the others under pain of being excluded from the guild.<br/>
None could station more than a certain number of days along the quay;<br/>
and if the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er found no <a href="good.htm">good</a>s to <a href="carry.htm">carry</a> during that <a href="time.htm">time</a>, so much the<br/>
worse for him; he had to depart with his empty barge to leave room for<br/>
<a href="new.htm">new</a>comers. Obstruction was thus avoided, even though the competition<br/>
between the private <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of the boats continued to exist. Were the<br/>
latter suppressed, the <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment would have been only the more cordial.<br/>
<br/>
It is unnecessary to add that the shipowners could adhere or not to the<br/>
syndicate. That was their business, but most of them elected to <a href="join.htm">join</a> it.<br/>
Moreover, these syndicates offered such great advantages that they<br/>
spread also along the Rhine, the Weser, the Oder, and as far as Berlin.<br/>
The boatmen did not wait for a great Bismarck to annex Hol<a href="land.htm">land</a> to<br/>
Germany, and to ap<a href="point.htm">point</a> an Ober Haupt General Staats Canal Navigation's<br/>
Rath <small>(Supreme Head Councillor of the General States Canal Navigation)</small>,<br/>
with a number of <a href="gold.htm">gold</a> stripes on his sleeves, corresponding to the<br/>
length of the title. They preferred coming to an international<br/>
understanding. Besides, a number of shipowners, whose sailing-vessels<br/>
ply between Germany and Scandinavia, as well as Russia, have also <a href="join.htm">join</a>ed<br/>
these syndicates, in order to regu<a href="late.htm">late</a> traffic in the Baltic, and to<br/>
bring about a certain harmony in the _chassé-croisé_ of vessels. These<br/>
associations have sprung up <a href="free.htm">free</a>ly, recruiting volunteer adhe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>s, and<br/>
have nought in <a href="common.htm">common</a> with governments.<br/>
<br/>
It is, however, more than probable that here too greater <a href="capital.htm">capital</a><br/>
oppresses lesser. Maybe the syndicate has also a tendency to become a<br/>
monopoly, especially where it receives the precious patronage of the<br/>
State that surely did not fail to interfere with it. Let <a href="us.htm">us</a> not forget<br/>
either, that these syndicates represent associations whose members have<br/>
only private <a href="interest.htm">interest</a>s at stake, and that if at the same <a href="time.htm">time</a> each<br/>
shipowner were compelled--by the socializing of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>ption,<br/>
and <a href="exch.htm">exch</a>ange--to belong to federated <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>es, or to a hundred other<br/>
associations for the satisfying of his <a href="need.htm">need</a>s, <a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s would have a<br/>
diffe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> aspect. A <a href="group.htm">group</a> of shipowners, powerful on sea, would feel<br/>
weak on <a href="land.htm">land</a>, and they would be obliged to lessen their claims in order<br/>
to come to <a href="term.htm">term</a>s with railways, <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies, and other <a href="group.htm">group</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, without discussing the <a href="future.htm">future</a>, here is another spontaneous<br/>
association that has dispensed with Government. Let <a href="us.htm">us</a> quote more<br/>
examples.<br/>
<br/>
As <a href="we.htm">we</a> are talking of ships and boats, let <a href="us.htm">us</a> mention one of the most<br/>
splendid <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nizations that the nineteenth century has brought forth,<br/>
one of those <a href="we.htm">we</a> may with right be proud of--the English Lifeboat<br/>
Association.<br/>
<br/>
It is known that every year more than a thousand ships are wrecked on<br/>
the shores of Eng<a href="land.htm">land</a>. At sea a <a href="good.htm">good</a> ship seldom fears a storm. It is<br/>
near the coasts that danger threatens--rough seas that shatter her<br/>
stern-post, squalls that <a href="carry.htm">carry</a> off her masts and sails, <a href="cur.htm">cur</a><a href="rent.htm">rent</a>s that<br/>
render her unmanageable, reefs and sand banks on which she runs aground.<br/>
<br/>
Even in <a href="old.htm">old</a>en <a href="time.htm">time</a>s, when it was a <a href="cust.htm">cust</a>om among inhabitants of the<br/>
coasts to light fires in order to attract vessels on to reefs, in order<br/>
to plunder their cargoes, they always strove to save the crew. Seeing a<br/>
ship in distress, they launched their boats and went to the rescue of<br/>
shipwrecked sailors, only too often finding a <a href="water.htm">water</a>y grave themselves.<br/>
Every hamlet along the sea shore has its legends of heroism, displayed<br/>
by woman as well as by man, to save crews in distress.<br/>
<br/>
No doubt the State and men of science have done some<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> to diminish<br/>
the number of casualties. Lighthouses, signals, charts, meteorological<br/>
warnings have diminished them greatly, but there remains a thousand<br/>
ships and several thousand human lives to be saved every year.<br/>
<br/>
To this end a few men of <a href="good.htm">good</a>will put their shoulders to the wheel.<br/>
Being <a href="good.htm">good</a> sailors and navigators themselves, they invented a lifeboat<br/>
that could weather a storm without being torn to pieces or capsizing,<br/>
and they set to <a href="work.htm">work</a> to <a href="interest.htm">interest</a> the public in their venture, to collect<br/>
the necessary funds for constructing boats, and for stationing them<br/>
along the coasts, wherever they could be of <a href="use.htm">use</a>.<br/>
<br/>
These men, not being Jacobins, did not turn to the Government. They<br/>
understood that to bring their enterprise to a successful issue they<br/>
<a href="must.htm">must</a> have the co-operation, the enthusiasm, the local knowledge, and<br/>
especially the self-sacrifice of the local sailors. They also understood<br/>
that to find men who at the first signal would launch their boat at<br/>
night, in a chaos of waves, not suffering themselves to be deterred by<br/>
darkness or breakers, and struggling five, six, ten hours aga<a href="inst.htm">inst</a> the<br/>
tide before reaching a vessel in distress--men ready to risk their lives<br/>
to save those of others--there <a href="must.htm">must</a> be a feeling of solidarity, a spirit<br/>
of sacrifice not to be bought with galloon. It was therefore a perfectly<br/>
spontaneous movement, sprung from <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment and individual initiative.<br/>
Hundreds of local <a href="group.htm">group</a>s arose along the coasts. The initiators had the<br/>
<a href="common.htm">common</a> senses not to pose as masters. They looked for sagacity in the<br/>
<a href="fish.htm">fish</a>ermen's hamlets, and when a rich man sent £1,000 to a village on the<br/>
coast to erect a lifeboat station, and his offer was accepted, he left<br/>
the choice of a site to the local <a href="fish.htm">fish</a>ermen and sailors.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>els of <a href="new.htm">new</a> boats were not submitted to the Admiralty. <a href="we.htm">We</a> read in a<br/>
Re<a href="port.htm">port</a> of the Association: "As it is of im<a href="port.htm">port</a>ance that life-boatmen<br/>
should have full confidence in the vessel they man, the <a href="commit.htm">Commit</a>tee will<br/>
<a href="make.htm">make</a> a <a href="point.htm">point</a> of constructing and equipping the boats according to the<br/>
life-boatmen's expressed wish." In consequence every year brings with it<br/>
<a href="new.htm">new</a> improvements.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="work.htm">work</a> is wholly conducted by volunteers <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nizing in <a href="commit.htm">commit</a>tees and<br/>
local <a href="group.htm">group</a>s; by mutual aid and <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment!--Oh, Anarchists! Moreover,<br/>
they ask no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> of the ratepayers, and in a year they may receive<br/>
£40,000 in spontaneous subscriptions.<br/>
<br/>
As to the results, here they are: In 1891 the Association possessed 293<br/>
lifeboats. The same year it saved 601 shipwrecked sailors and 33<br/>
vessels. Since its foundation it has saved 32,671 human beings.<br/>
<br/>
In 1886, three lifeboats with all their men having perished at sea,<br/>
hundreds of <a href="new.htm">new</a> volunteers entered their <a href="name.htm">name</a>s, <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nized themselves<br/>
into local <a href="group.htm">group</a>s, and the agitation resulted in the construction of<br/>
twenty additional boats. As <a href="we.htm">we</a> proceed, let <a href="us.htm">us</a> <a href="note.htm">note</a> that every year the<br/>
Association sends to the <a href="fish.htm">fish</a>ermen and sailors ex<a href="cell.htm">cell</a>ent barometers at a<br/>
<a href="price.htm">price</a> three <a href="time.htm">time</a>s less than their sale <a href="price.htm">price</a> in private shops. It<br/>
propagates meteorological knowledge, and warns the parties concerned of<br/>
the sudden <a href="chang.htm">chang</a>es of weather predicted by men of science.<br/>
<br/>
Let <a href="us.htm">us</a> repeat that these hundreds of <a href="commit.htm">commit</a>tees and local <a href="group.htm">group</a>s are<br/>
not <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nized hierarchically, and are composed exclusively of<br/>
volunteers, lifeboatmen, and people <a href="interest.htm">interest</a>ed in the <a href="work.htm">work</a>. The Central<br/>
<a href="commit.htm">Commit</a>tee, which is more of a centre for correspondence, in no wise<br/>
interferes.<br/>
<br/>
It is true that when a voting on some question of education or local<br/>
<a href="tax.htm">tax</a>ation takes place in a district, these <a href="commit.htm">commit</a>tees of the National<br/>
Lifeboat Association do not, as such, take part in the deliberations--a<br/>
<a href="mod.htm">mod</a>esty, which unfortunately the members of elected bodies do not<br/>
imitate. But, on the other hand, these brave men do not allow those who<br/>
have never faced a storm to legis<a href="late.htm">late</a> for them about saving life. At the<br/>
first signal of distress they rush to their boats, and go ahead. There<br/>
are no embroidered uniforms, but much <a href="good.htm">good</a>will.<br/>
<br/>
Let <a href="us.htm">us</a> take another society of the same kind, that of the Red <a href="cross.htm">Cross</a>. The<br/>
<a href="name.htm">name</a> <a href="matt.htm">matt</a>ers little; let <a href="us.htm">us</a> examine it.<br/>
<br/>
Imagine somebody saying fifty years ago: "The State, capable as it is of<br/>
massacring twenty thousand men in a day, and of wounding fifty thousand<br/>
more, is incapable of helping its <a href="own.htm">own</a> victims; consequently, as long as<br/>
war exists private initiative <a href="must.htm">must</a> intervene, and men of <a href="good.htm">good</a>will <a href="must.htm">must</a><br/>
<a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nize internationally for this humane <a href="work.htm">work</a>!" What mockery would not<br/>
have met the man who would have dared to speak thus! To begin with, he<br/>
would have been called a Utopian, and if that did not silence him he<br/>
would have been told: "What nonsense! Your volunteers will be found<br/>
<a href="want.htm">want</a>ing precisely where they are most <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed, your volunteer hospitals<br/>
will be centralized in a safe place, while every<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> will be <a href="want.htm">want</a>ing in<br/>
the ambulances. Utopians like you forget the national rivalries which<br/>
will cause the poor <a href="sold.htm">sold</a>iers to die without any help." Such<br/>
disheartening remarks would have only been equalled by the number of<br/>
speakers. Who of <a href="us.htm">us</a> has not heard men <a href="hold.htm">hold</a> forth in this strain?<br/>
<br/>
Now <a href="we.htm">we</a> know what happened. Red <a href="cross.htm">Cross</a> societies <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nized themselves<br/>
<a href="free.htm">free</a>ly, everywhere, in all countries, in thousands of localities; and<br/>
when the war of 1870-1 broke out, the volunteers set to <a href="work.htm">work</a>. Men and<br/>
women offered their <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ices. Thousands of hospitals and ambulances<br/>
were <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nized; trains were <a href="star.htm">star</a>ted <a href="carry.htm">carry</a>ing ambulances, provisions,<br/>
linen, and <a href="medic.htm">medic</a>aments for the wounded. The English <a href="commit.htm">commit</a>tees sent<br/>
entire convoys of <a href="food.htm">food</a>, <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>ing, tools, grain to sow, beasts of<br/>
draught, even s<a href="team.htm">team</a>-ploughs with their attendants to help in the tillage<br/>
of departments <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>astated by the war! Only consult _La Croix Rouge_, by<br/>
Gustave Moynier, and you will be really struck by the immensity of the<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a> performed.<br/>
<br/>
As to the prophets ever ready to deny other men's courage, <a href="good.htm">good</a> sense,<br/>
and intelligence, and believing themselves to be the only ones capable<br/>
of ruling the world with a rod, none of their predictions were realized.<br/>
The <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>otion of the Red <a href="cross.htm">Cross</a> volunteers was beyond all praise. They<br/>
were only too eager to occupy the most dangerous posts; and whereas the<br/>
salaried doctors of the Napoleonic State fled with their staff when the<br/>
Prussians approached, the Red <a href="cross.htm">Cross</a> volunteers continued their <a href="work.htm">work</a><br/>
under fire, enduring the brutalities of Bismarck's and Napoleon's<br/>
officers, lavishing their care on the wounded of all nationalities.<br/>
Dutch, Italians, Swedes, Belgians, even Japanese and Chinese <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>d<br/>
remarkably well. They distributed their hospitals and their ambulances<br/>
according to the <a href="need.htm">need</a>s of the occasion. They vied with one another<br/>
especially in the hygiene of their hospitals. And there is many a<br/>
Frenchman who still speaks with deep gratitude of the tender care he<br/>
received from the Dutch or German volunteers in the Red <a href="cross.htm">Cross</a><br/>
ambulances. But what is this to an authoritarian? His ideal is the<br/>
regiment doctor, salaried by the State. What does he care for the Red<br/>
<a href="cross.htm">Cross</a> and its hygienic hospitals, if the nurses be not functionaries!<br/>
<br/>
Here is then an <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization, sprung up but yesterday, and which reckons<br/>
its members by hundreds of thousands; possesses ambulances, hospital<br/>
trains, e<a href="labor.htm">labor</a>ates <a href="new.htm">new</a> processes for treating wounds, and so on, and is<br/>
due to the spontaneous initiative of a few <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>oted men.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps <a href="we.htm">we</a> shall be told that the State has some<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> to do with this<br/>
<a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization. Yes, States have laid hands on it to seize it. The<br/>
directing <a href="commit.htm">commit</a>tees are presided over by those whom flunkeys call<br/>
princes of the blood. Emperors and queens lavishly patronize the<br/>
national <a href="commit.htm">commit</a>tees. But it is not to this patronage that the success of<br/>
the <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization is due. It is to the thousand local <a href="commit.htm">commit</a>tees of each<br/>
nation; to the <a href="act.htm">act</a>ivity of individuals, to the <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>otion of all those who<br/>
try to help the victims of war. And this <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>otion would be far greater<br/>
if the State did not meddle with it.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, it was not by the order of an International Directing<br/>
<a href="commit.htm">Commit</a>tee that Englishmen and Japanese, Swedes and Chi<a href="name.htm">name</a>n, bestirred<br/>
themselves to send help to the wounded in 1871. It was not by order of<br/>
an international ministry that hospitals rose on the invaded territory<br/>
and that ambulances were carried on to the battlefield. It was by the<br/>
initiative of volunteers from each country. Once on the spot, they did<br/>
not get <a href="hold.htm">hold</a> of one another by the hair as was foreseen by the<br/>
Jacobinists of all nations; they all set to <a href="work.htm">work</a> without distinction of<br/>
nationality.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> may regret that such great efforts should be put to the <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ice of so<br/>
bad a cause, and <a href="we.htm">we</a> may ask <a href="our.htm">our</a>selves like the poet's child: "Why<br/>
inflict wounds if you are to <a href="heal.htm">heal</a> them afterwards?" In striving to<br/>
destroy the power of <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ist and middle-<a href="class.htm">class</a> authority, <a href="we.htm">we</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a> to<br/>
put an end to the massacres called wars, and <a href="we.htm">we</a> would far rather see the<br/>
Red <a href="cross.htm">Cross</a> volunteers put forth their <a href="act.htm">act</a>ivity to bring about <small>(with <a href="us.htm">us</a>)</small><br/>
the suppression of war; but <a href="we.htm">we</a> had to mention this immense <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization<br/>
as another illustration of results <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed by <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment and <a href="free.htm">free</a><br/>
aid.<br/>
<br/>
If <a href="we.htm">we</a> wished to multiply examples taken from the art of ex<a href="term.htm">term</a>inating<br/>
men <a href="we.htm">we</a> should never end. Suffice to quote the numerous societies to<br/>
which the German army owes its force, that does not only depend on<br/>
discipline, as is generally believed. I mean the societies whose aim is<br/>
to propagate military knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
At one of the last congresses of the Military Alliance <small>(Kriegerbund)</small>,<br/>
delegates from 2,452 federated societies, comprising 151,712 members,<br/>
were present. But there are besides very numerous Shooting, Military<br/>
<a href="game.htm">Game</a>s, Strategical <a href="game.htm">Game</a>s, Topographical Studies Societies--these are the<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>shops in which the technical knowledge of the German army is<br/>
<a href="dev.htm">dev</a>eloped, not in regimental schools. It is a formidable net<a href="work.htm">work</a> of all<br/>
kinds of societies, including military men and civilians, geographers<br/>
and gymnasts, s<a href="port.htm">port</a>smen and technologists, which rise up spontaneously,<br/>
<a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nize, federate, discuss, and explore the country. It is these<br/>
voluntary and <a href="free.htm">free</a> associations that go to <a href="make.htm">make</a> the real backbone of the<br/>
German army.<br/>
<br/>
Their aim is execrable. It is the maintenance of the Empire. But what<br/>
concerns <a href="us.htm">us</a>, is to <a href="point.htm">point</a> out that, in spite of military <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization<br/>
being the "Great Mission of the State," success in this branch is the<br/>
more certain the more it is left to the <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment of <a href="group.htm">group</a>s and to<br/>
the <a href="free.htm">free</a> initiative of individuals.<br/>
<br/>
Even in <a href="matt.htm">matt</a>ers pertaining to war, <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment is thus appealed to;<br/>
and to further prove <a href="our.htm">our</a> assertion let <a href="us.htm">us</a> mention the Volunteer<br/>
Topographers' Corps of Switzer<a href="land.htm">land</a> who study in detail the mountain<br/>
<a href="pass.htm">pass</a>ages, the Aero<a href="plan.htm">plan</a>e Corps of France, the three hundred thousand<br/>
British volunteers, the British National Artillery Association, and the<br/>
Society, now in course of <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization, for the defence of Eng<a href="land.htm">land</a>'s<br/>
coasts, as well as the appeals made to the <a href="commer.htm">commer</a>cial fleet, the<br/>
Bicyclists' Corps, and the <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nizations of private motorcars and<br/>
s<a href="team.htm">team</a> launches.<br/>
<br/>
Everywhere the State is abdicating and abandoning its holy functions to<br/>
private individuals. Everywhere <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization tres<a href="pass.htm">pass</a>es on its<br/>
domain. And yet, the facts <a href="we.htm">we</a> have quoted give <a href="us.htm">us</a> only a glimpse of what<br/>
<a href="free.htm">free</a> government has in store for <a href="us.htm">us</a> in the <a href="future.htm">future</a> when there will be no<br/>
more State.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
CHAPTER XII<br/>
<br/>
<a href="object.htm">OBJECT</a>IONS<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I<br/>
<br/>
Let <a href="us.htm">us</a> now examine the principal <a href="object.htm">object</a>ions put forth aga<a href="inst.htm">inst</a> <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ism.<br/>
Most of them are evidently caused by a simple misunderstanding, yet they<br/>
raise im<a href="port.htm">port</a>ant questions and merit <a href="our.htm">our</a> attention.<br/>
<br/>
It is not for <a href="us.htm">us</a> to answer the <a href="object.htm">object</a>ions raised by authoritarian<br/>
<a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ism--<a href="we.htm">we</a> <a href="our.htm">our</a>selves <a href="hold.htm">hold</a> with them. Civilized nations have suffered<br/>
too much in the long, hard struggle for the emancipation of the<br/>
individual, to disown their <a href="past.htm">past</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a> and to tolerate a Government that<br/>
would <a href="make.htm">make</a> itself felt in the smallest details of a citizen's life, even<br/>
if that Government had no other aim than the <a href="good.htm">good</a> of the <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ity.<br/>
Should an authoritarian Socialist society ever succeed in establishing<br/>
itself, it could not last; general discontent would soon force it to<br/>
break up, or to re<a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nize itself on principles of liberty.<br/>
<br/>
It is of an Anarchist-<a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ist society <a href="we.htm">we</a> are about to speak, a society<br/>
that recognizes the ab<a href="solu.htm">solu</a>te liberty of the individual, that does not<br/>
admit of any authority, and <a href="make.htm">make</a>s <a href="use.htm">use</a> of no compulsion to drive men to<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>. Limiting <a href="our.htm">our</a> studies to the <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic side of the question, let <a href="us.htm">us</a><br/>
see if such a society, composed of men as they are to-day, neither<br/>
better nor worse, neither more nor less industrious, would have a chance<br/>
of successful <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>elopment.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="object.htm">object</a>ion is known. "If the existence of each is guaranteed, and if<br/>
the necessity of earning <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>s does not compel men to <a href="work.htm">work</a>, nobody will<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>. Every man will lay the burden of his <a href="work.htm">work</a> on another if he is not<br/>
forced to do it himself." Let <a href="us.htm">us</a> first <a href="note.htm">note</a> the incredible levity with<br/>
which this <a href="object.htm">object</a>ion is raised, without even realizing that the real<br/>
question raised by this <a href="object.htm">object</a>ion is merely to know, on the one hand,<br/>
whether you effectively obtain by <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>-<a href="work.htm">work</a>, the results that are said<br/>
to be obtained, and, on the other hand, whether voluntary <a href="work.htm">work</a> is not<br/>
already now more <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive than <a href="work.htm">work</a> stimu<a href="late.htm">late</a>d by <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>s. A question<br/>
which, to be dealt with <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ly, would require a serious study. But<br/>
whereas in exact sciences men give their opinion on subjects infinitely<br/>
less im<a href="port.htm">port</a>ant and less complicated after serious research, after<br/>
carefully collecting and analyzing facts--on this question they will<br/>
pronounce judgment without appeal, resting satisfied with any one<br/>
particular event, such as, for example, the <a href="want.htm">want</a> of success of some<br/>
<a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ist association in America. They <a href="act.htm">act</a> like the barrister who does<br/>
not see in the counsel for the opposite side a representative of a<br/>
cause, or an opinion contrary to his <a href="own.htm">own</a>, but a simple nuisance,--an<br/>
adversary in an oratorical debate; and if he be lucky enough to find a<br/>
repartee, does not otherwise care to justify his cause. Therefore the<br/>
study of this essential basis of all Political <a href="econ.htm">Econ</a>omy, _the study of<br/>
the most favourable conditions for giving society the greatest amount of<br/>
<a href="use.htm">use</a>ful <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts with the least waste of human energy_, does not advance.<br/>
People either limit themselves to repeating <a href="common.htm">common</a>place assertions, or<br/>
else they pretend ignorance of <a href="our.htm">our</a> assertions.<br/>
<br/>
What is most striking in this levity is that even in <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ist<br/>
Political <a href="econ.htm">Econ</a>omy you already find a few writers compelled by facts to<br/>
doubt the axiom put forth by the founders of their science, that the<br/>
threat of hunger is man's best stimulant for <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive <a href="work.htm">work</a>. They begin<br/>
to perceive that in <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion a certain _collective element_ is<br/>
introduced, which has been too much neglected up till now, and which<br/>
might be more im<a href="port.htm">port</a>ant than <a href="person.htm">person</a>al gain. The inferior quality of<br/>
<a href="wage.htm">wage</a>-<a href="work.htm">work</a>, the terrible waste of human energy in <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>cultural and<br/>
industrial labour, the ever-<a href="grow.htm">grow</a>ing quantity of pleasure-seekers, who<br/>
shift their burden on to others' shoulders, the absence of a certain<br/>
animation in <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion that is becoming more and more appa<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>; all<br/>
this is beginning to preoccupy the <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omists of the "<a href="class.htm">class</a>ical" school.<br/>
Some of them ask themselves if they have not got on the wrong track: if<br/>
the imaginary evil being, that was supposed to be tempted exclusively by<br/>
a bait of lucre or <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>s, really exists. This heresy penetrates even<br/>
into universities; it is found in books of orthodox <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy.<br/>
<br/>
But this does not prevent a great many Socialist reformers from<br/>
remaining partisans of individual remuneration, and defending the <a href="old.htm">old</a><br/>
citadel of <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>dom, notwithstanding that it is being delivered over<br/>
stone by stone to the assailants by its former defenders.<br/>
<br/>
They fear that without compulsion the masses will not <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
But during <a href="our.htm">our</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a> life<a href="time.htm">time</a>, have <a href="we.htm">we</a> not heard the same fears expressed<br/>
twice? Once, by the anti-abolitionists in America before the<br/>
emancipation of the Negroes, and, for a s<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>d <a href="time.htm">time</a>, by the Russian<br/>
nobility before the liberation of the serfs? "Without the whip the Negro<br/>
will not <a href="work.htm">work</a>," said the anti-abolitionist. "<a href="free.htm">Free</a> from their master's<br/>
supervision the serfs will leave the fields uncultivated," said the<br/>
Russian serf-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers. It was the refrain of the French noblemen in 1789,<br/>
the refrain of the Middle Ages, a refrain as <a href="old.htm">old</a> as the world, and <a href="we.htm">we</a><br/>
shall hear it every <a href="time.htm">time</a> there is a question of sweeping away an<br/>
injustice. And each <a href="time.htm">time</a> <a href="act.htm">act</a>ual facts give it the lie. The liberated<br/>
peasant of 1792 ploughed with an eager energy, unknown to his ancestors;<br/>
the emancipated Negro <a href="work.htm">work</a>s more than his fathers; and the Russian<br/>
peasant, after having honoured the honeymoon of his emancipation by<br/>
celebrating Fridays as well as <a href="sun.htm">Sun</a>days, has taken up <a href="work.htm">work</a> with an<br/>
eagerness pro<a href="port.htm">port</a>ionate to the completeness of his liberation. There,<br/>
where the soil is his, he <a href="work.htm">work</a>s desperately; that is the exact <a href="word.htm">word</a> for<br/>
it. The anti-abolitionist refrain can be of <a href="valu.htm">valu</a>e to slave-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers; as to<br/>
the slaves themselves, they know what it is <a href="worth.htm">worth</a>, as they know its<br/>
motive.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, who but the <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omists themselves taught <a href="us.htm">us</a> that while a<br/>
<a href="wage.htm">wage</a>-earner's <a href="work.htm">work</a> is very often indiffe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>, an intense and <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a> is only obtained from a man who sees his wealth increase in<br/>
pro<a href="port.htm">port</a>ion to his efforts? All hymns <a href="sun.htm">sun</a>g in honour of private <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty<br/>
can be reduced to this axiom.<br/>
<br/>
For it is remarkable that when <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omists, wishing to celebrate the<br/>
blessings of <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty, show <a href="us.htm">us</a> how an un<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive, marshy, or stony<br/>
soil is <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>ed with rich har<a href="vest.htm">vest</a>s when cultivated by the peasant<br/>
proprietor, they in nowise prove their thesis in favour of private<br/>
<a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty. By admitting that the only guarantee not to be robbed of the<br/>
fruits of your labour is to possess the <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ruments of labour--which is<br/>
true--the <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omists only prove that man really <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>es most when he<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>s in <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom, when he has a certain choice in his occupations, when<br/>
he has no overseer to impede him, and lastly, when he sees his <a href="work.htm">work</a><br/>
bringing in a <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> to him and to others who <a href="work.htm">work</a> like him, but<br/>
bringing in little to idlers. No<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> else can be deducted from their<br/>
argumentation, and this is what <a href="we.htm">we</a> maintain <a href="our.htm">our</a>selves.<br/>
<br/>
As to the form of possession of the <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ruments of labour, the<br/>
<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omists only mention it _indirectly_ in their demonstration, as a<br/>
guarantee to the cultivator that he shall not be robbed of the <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s<br/>
of his yield nor of his improvements. Besides, in sup<a href="port.htm">port</a> of their<br/>
thesis in favour of _private <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty_ aga<a href="inst.htm">inst</a> all other forms of<br/>
_possession_, should not the <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omists demonstrate that under the form<br/>
of <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>al <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="land.htm">land</a> never <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>es such rich har<a href="vest.htm">vest</a>s as when the<br/>
possession is private? But this they could not prove; in fact, it is the<br/>
contrary that has been ob<a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ed.<br/>
<br/>
Take for example a <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>e in the canton of Vaud, in the <a href="win.htm">win</a>ter <a href="time.htm">time</a>,<br/>
when all the men of the village go to fell wood in the forest, which<br/>
belongs to them all. It is precisely during these festivals of labour<br/>
that the greatest ardour for <a href="work.htm">work</a> and the most considerable display of<br/>
human energy are appa<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>. No salaried labour, no effort of a private<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a>er can bear comparison with it.<br/>
<br/>
Or let <a href="us.htm">us</a> take a Russian village, when all its inhabitants mow a field<br/>
belonging to the <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>e, or <a href="farm.htm">farm</a>ed by it. There you will see what man<br/>
_can_ <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e when he <a href="work.htm">work</a>s in <a href="common.htm">common</a> for <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>al <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion. Comrades<br/>
vie with one another in cutting the widest swathe, women bestir<br/>
themselves in their wake so as not to be distanced by the mowers. It is<br/>
a festival of labour, in which a hundred people accomplish in a few<br/>
hours a <a href="work.htm">work</a> that would not have been finished in a few days had they<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>ed separately. What a miserable contrast compared to them is offered<br/>
by the <a href="work.htm">work</a> of the iso<a href="late.htm">late</a>d <a href="own.htm">own</a>er!<br/>
<br/>
In fact, <a href="we.htm">we</a> might quote scores of examples among the pioneers of<br/>
America, in Swiss, German, Russian, and in certain French villages; or<br/>
the <a href="work.htm">work</a> done in Russia by gangs <small>(_artels)</small>_ of masons, carpenters,<br/>
boatmen, <a href="fish.htm">fish</a>ermen, etc., who undertake a task and divide the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e or<br/>
the remuneration among themselves without it <a href="pass.htm">pass</a>ing through an<br/>
in<a href="term.htm">term</a>ediary of middlemen; or else the amount of <a href="work.htm">work</a> I saw performed in<br/>
English ship-yards when the remuneration was <a href="paid.htm">paid</a> on the same principle.<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> could also mention the great <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>al hunts of nomadic tribes, and an<br/>
infinite number of successful collective enterprises. And in every case<br/>
<a href="we.htm">we</a> could show the unquestionable superiority of <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>al <a href="work.htm">work</a> compared<br/>
to that of the <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>-earner or the iso<a href="late.htm">late</a>d private <a href="own.htm">own</a>er.<br/>
<br/>
Well-being--that is to say, the satisfaction of <a href="phys.htm">phys</a>ical, artistic, and<br/>
moral <a href="need.htm">need</a>s, has always been the most powerful stimulant to <a href="work.htm">work</a>. And<br/>
where a hireling hardly succeeds to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e the bare necessities with<br/>
difficulty, a <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a>er, who sees ease and luxury increasing for him<br/>
and for others in pro<a href="port.htm">port</a>ion to his efforts, spends infinitely far more<br/>
energy and intelligence, and obtains <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts in a far greater<br/>
<a href="abund.htm">abund</a>ance. The one feels riveted to misery, the other hopes for ease and<br/>
luxury in the <a href="future.htm">future</a>. In this lies the whole secret. Therefore a society<br/>
aiming at the well-being of all, and at the possibility of all enjoying<br/>
life in all its manifestations, will give voluntary <a href="work.htm">work</a>, which will be<br/>
infinitely superior and yield far more than <a href="work.htm">work</a> has <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed up till<br/>
now under the goad of slavery, serfdom, or <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>dom.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
II<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays, whoever can load on others his <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e of labour indispensable<br/>
to existence does so, and it is believed that it will always be so.<br/>
<br/>
Now, <a href="work.htm">work</a> indispensable to existence is essentially manual. <a href="we.htm">We</a> may be<br/>
artists or scientists; but none of <a href="us.htm">us</a> can do without <a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s obtained by<br/>
manual <a href="work.htm">work</a>--<a href="bread.htm">bread</a>, <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>es, roads, ships, light, heat, etc. And,<br/>
moreover, however highly artistic or however subtly <a href="meta.htm">meta</a><a href="phys.htm">phys</a>ical are <a href="our.htm">our</a><br/>
pleasures, they all depend on manual labour. And it is precisely this<br/>
labour--the basis of life--that everyone tries to avoid.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> understand perfectly well that it <a href="must.htm">must</a> be so nowadays.<br/>
<br/>
Because, to do manual <a href="work.htm">work</a> now, <a href="means.htm">means</a> in reality to shut yourself up for<br/>
ten or twelve hours a day in an un<a href="heal.htm">heal</a>thy <a href="work.htm">work</a>shop, and to remain<br/>
chained to the same task for twenty or thirty years, and maybe for your<br/>
whole life.<br/>
<br/>
It <a href="means.htm">means</a> to be doomed to a paltry <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>, to the uncertainty of the<br/>
morrow, to <a href="want.htm">want</a> of <a href="work.htm">work</a>, often to destitution, more often than not to<br/>
death in a hospital, after having <a href="work.htm">work</a>ed forty years to feed, <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>e,<br/>
amuse, and <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ruct others than yourself and your children.<br/>
<br/>
It <a href="means.htm">means</a> to bear the stamp of inferiority all your life; because,<br/>
whatever the politicians tell <a href="us.htm">us</a>, the manual <a href="work.htm">work</a>er is always considered<br/>
inferior to the brain <a href="work.htm">work</a>er, and the one who has toiled ten hours in a<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>shop has not the <a href="time.htm">time</a>, and still less the <a href="means.htm">means</a>, to give himself the<br/>
high delights of science and art, nor even to prepare himself to<br/>
appreciate them; he <a href="must.htm">must</a> be content with the crumbs from the table of<br/>
privileged <a href="person.htm">person</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> understand that under these conditions manual labour is considered a<br/>
<a href="cur.htm">cur</a>se of fate.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> understand that all men have but one dream--that of emerging from, or<br/>
enabling their children to emerge from this inferior state; to <a href="creat.htm">creat</a>e<br/>
for themselves an "independent" position, which <a href="means.htm">means</a> what?--To also<br/>
live by other men's <a href="work.htm">work</a>!<br/>
<br/>
As long as there will be a <a href="class.htm">class</a> of manual <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers and a <a href="class.htm">class</a> of<br/>
"brain" <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers, black hands and white hands, it will be thus.<br/>
<br/>
What <a href="interest.htm">interest</a>, in fact, can this depressing <a href="work.htm">work</a> have for the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er,<br/>
when he knows that the fate awaiting him from the cradle to the grave<br/>
will be to live in mediocrity, po<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>y, and in<a href="secur.htm">secur</a>ity of the morrow?<br/>
Therefore, when <a href="we.htm">we</a> see the immense majority of men take up their<br/>
wretched task every morning, <a href="we.htm">we</a> feel surprised at their perseverance, at<br/>
their zeal for <a href="work.htm">work</a>, at the habit that enables them, like machines<br/>
blindly obeying an impetus given, to lead this life of misery without<br/>
hope for the morrow; without foreseeing ever so vaguely that some day<br/>
they, or at least their children, will be part of a humanity rich in all<br/>
the treasures of a bountiful nature, in all the enjoyments of knowledge,<br/>
scientific and artistic <a href="creat.htm">creat</a>ion, re<a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ed to-day to a few privileged<br/>
favourites.<br/>
<br/>
It is precisely to put an end to this separation between manual and<br/>
brain <a href="work.htm">work</a> that <a href="we.htm">we</a> <a href="want.htm">want</a> to abolish <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>dom, that <a href="we.htm">we</a> <a href="want.htm">want</a> the Social<br/>
Revolution. Then <a href="work.htm">work</a> will no longer appear a <a href="cur.htm">cur</a>se of fate: it will<br/>
become what it should be--the <a href="free.htm">free</a> exercise of _all_ the faculties of<br/>
man.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, it is <a href="time.htm">time</a> to submit to a serious analysis this legend about<br/>
superior <a href="work.htm">work</a>, supposed to be obtained under the lash of <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>dom.<br/>
<br/>
It would be sufficient to visit, not the <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>y and <a href="work.htm">work</a>shop that<br/>
<a href="we.htm">we</a> find now and again, but a number of the ordinary <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies, to<br/>
conceive the immense waste of human energy that characterizes <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern<br/>
industry. For one <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>y more or less rationally <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nized, there are a<br/>
hundred or more which waste man's labour, without any more substantial<br/>
motive than that of perhaps bringing in a few pounds more per day to the<br/>
<a href="employ.htm">employ</a>er.<br/>
<br/>
Here you see youths from twenty to twenty-five years of age, sitting all<br/>
day long on a bench, their chests <a href="sun.htm">sun</a>ken in, feverishly shaking their<br/>
heads and bodies, to tie, with the speed of conjurers, the two ends of<br/>
<a href="worth.htm">worth</a>less scraps of cotton, the refuse of the lace-looms. What progeny<br/>
will these trembling and rickety bodies bequeath to their country? "But<br/>
they occupy so little room in the <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>y, and each of them brings me in<br/>
sixpence net every day," will say the <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>er.<br/>
<br/>
In an immense London <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>y <a href="we.htm">we</a> saw girls, bald at seventeen from<br/>
<a href="carry.htm">carry</a>ing trays of matches on their heads from one room to another, when<br/>
the simplest machine could wheel the matches to their tables. But "It<br/>
<a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s so little, the <a href="work.htm">work</a> of women who have no special <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e! Why should<br/>
<a href="we.htm">we</a> <a href="use.htm">use</a> a machine? When these can do no more, they will be easily<br/>
replaced, there are so many of them in the street!"<br/>
<br/>
On the steps of a mansion on an icy night you will find a bare-footed<br/>
child asleep, with its bundle of papers in its arms ... child-labour<br/>
<a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s so little that it may be well <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ed, every evening, to <a href="sell.htm">sell</a><br/>
tenpenny-<a href="worth.htm">worth</a> of papers, of which the poor boy will receive a penny, or<br/>
a penny halfpenny. And continually in all big cities you may see robust<br/>
men tramping about who have been out of <a href="work.htm">work</a> for months, while their<br/>
daughters <a href="grow.htm">grow</a> pale in the overheated vapours of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>shops for<br/>
dressing stuffs, and their sons are filling blacking-pots by hand, or<br/>
spend those years during which they ought to have learned a <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e, in<br/>
<a href="carry.htm">carry</a>ing about baskets for a greengrocer, and at the age of eighteen or<br/>
twenty become regular un<a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ed.<br/>
<br/>
And so it is everywhere, from San Francisco to Moscow, and from Naples<br/>
to Stockholm. The waste of human energy is the distinguishing and<br/>
predominant trait of <a href="our.htm">our</a> industry, not to mention <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e where it attains<br/>
still more colossal pro<a href="port.htm">port</a>ions.<br/>
<br/>
What a sad satire is that <a href="name.htm">name</a>, Political _<a href="econ.htm">Econ</a>omy_, given to the<br/>
science of waste and energy under the system of <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>dom!<br/>
<br/>
This is not all. If you speak to the director of a well-<a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nized<br/>
<a href="factor.htm">factor</a>y, he will naively explain to you that it is difficult nowadays to<br/>
find a skilful, vigorous, and energetic <a href="work.htm">work</a>man, who <a href="work.htm">work</a>s with a will.<br/>
"Should such a man present himself among the twenty or thirty who call<br/>
every Monday asking <a href="us.htm">us</a> for <a href="work.htm">work</a>, he is sure to be received, even if <a href="we.htm">we</a><br/>
are reducing the number of <a href="our.htm">our</a> hands. <a href="we.htm">We</a> recognize him at the first<br/>
glance, and he is always accepted, even though <a href="we.htm">we</a> have to get rid of an<br/>
<a href="old.htm">old</a>er and less <a href="act.htm">act</a>ive <a href="work.htm">work</a>er the next day." And the one who has just<br/>
received notice to quit, and all those who will receive it to-morrow, go<br/>
to re<a href="info.htm">info</a>rce that immense re<a href="serv.htm">serv</a>e-army of <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>--<a href="work.htm">work</a>men out of<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>--who are only called to the loom or the bench when there is<br/>
pressure of <a href="work.htm">work</a>, or to oppose strikers. And those others--the average<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>ers who are sent away by the better-<a href="class.htm">class</a> <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies as soon as<br/>
business is slackened? They also <a href="join.htm">join</a> the formidable army of aged and<br/>
indiffe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers who continually circu<a href="late.htm">late</a> among the s<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>d-<a href="class.htm">class</a><br/>
<a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies--those which barely cover their expenses and <a href="make.htm">make</a> their way in<br/>
the world by trickery and snares laid for the <a href="buy.htm">buy</a>er, and especially for<br/>
the <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>er in distant countries.<br/>
<br/>
And if you talk to the <a href="work.htm">work</a>men themselves, you will soon learn that the<br/>
rule in such <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies is--never to do your best. "Shoddy <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>--shoddy<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>!" this is the advice which the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing man receives from his<br/>
comrades upon entering such a <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>y.<br/>
<br/>
For the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers know that if in a moment of generosity they give way to<br/>
the entreaties of an <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>er and consent to intensify the <a href="work.htm">work</a> in order<br/>
to <a href="carry.htm">carry</a> out a pressing order, this nervous <a href="work.htm">work</a> will be exacted in the<br/>
<a href="future.htm">future</a> as a rule in the scale of <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>s. Therefore in all such <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies<br/>
they prefer never to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e as much as they can. In certain industries<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion is limited so as to keep up high <a href="price.htm">price</a>s, and some<a href="time.htm">time</a>s the<br/>
<a href="pass.htm">pass</a>-<a href="word.htm">word</a>, "Go-canny," is given, which signifies, "Bad <a href="work.htm">work</a> for bad<br/>
<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>!"<br/>
<br/>
<a href="wage.htm">Wage</a>-<a href="work.htm">work</a> is serf-<a href="work.htm">work</a>; it cannot, it <a href="must.htm">must</a> not, <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e all that it<br/>
could <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e. And it is high <a href="time.htm">time</a> to disbelieve the legend which<br/>
represents <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>dom as the best incentive to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive <a href="work.htm">work</a>. If industry<br/>
nowadays brings in a hundred <a href="time.htm">time</a>s more than it did in the days of <a href="our.htm">our</a><br/>
grandfathers, it is due to the sudden awakening of <a href="phys.htm">phys</a>ical and chemical<br/>
sciences towards the end of last century; not to the <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ist<br/>
<a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization of <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>dom, but _in spite_ of that <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
III<br/>
<br/>
Those who have seriously studied the question do not deny any of the<br/>
advantages of <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ism, on condition, be it well understood, that<br/>
<a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ism be perfectly <a href="free.htm">free</a>, that is to say, Anarchist. They recognize<br/>
that <a href="work.htm">work</a> <a href="paid.htm">paid</a> with <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y, even disguised under the <a href="name.htm">name</a> of "labour<br/>
cheques," to <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers' associations governed by the State, would keep up<br/>
the characteristics of <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>dom and would retain its disadvantages. They<br/>
<a href="agree.htm">agree</a> that the whole system would soon suffer from it, even if Society<br/>
came into possession of the <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ruments of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion. And they admit<br/>
that, thanks to an "integral" complete education given to all children,<br/>
to the <a href="labor.htm">labor</a>ious habits of civilized societies, with the liberty of<br/>
choosing and varying their occupations and the attractions of <a href="work.htm">work</a> done<br/>
by equals for the well-being of all, a <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ist society would not be<br/>
<a href="want.htm">want</a>ing in <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ers who would soon <a href="make.htm">make</a> the fertility of the soil<br/>
triple and tenfold, and give a <a href="new.htm">new</a> impulse to industry.<br/>
<br/>
This <a href="our.htm">our</a> opponents <a href="agree.htm">agree</a> to. "But the danger," they say, "will come from<br/>
that minority of loafers who will not <a href="work.htm">work</a>, and will not have regular<br/>
habits, in spite of the ex<a href="cell.htm">cell</a>ent conditions that would <a href="make.htm">make</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a><br/>
pleasant. To-day the prospect of hunger compels the most refractory to<br/>
move along with the others. The one who does not arrive in <a href="time.htm">time</a> is<br/>
dismissed. But one black sheep suffices to contaminate the whole f<a href="lock.htm">lock</a>,<br/>
and two or three sluggish or refractory <a href="work.htm">work</a>men would lead the others<br/>
astray and bring a spirit of disorder and rebellion into the <a href="work.htm">work</a>shop<br/>
that would <a href="make.htm">make</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a> impossible; so that in the end <a href="we.htm">we</a> should have to<br/>
<a href="return.htm">return</a> to a system of compulsion that would force such ringleaders back<br/>
into the ranks. And then,--Is not the system of <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>s, <a href="paid.htm">paid</a> in<br/>
pro<a href="port.htm">port</a>ion to <a href="work.htm">work</a> performed, the only one that enables compulsion to be<br/>
<a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ed, without hurting the feelings of independence of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er?<br/>
All other <a href="means.htm">means</a> would imply the continual intervention of an authority<br/>
that would be repugnant to <a href="free.htm">free</a> men." This, <a href="we.htm">we</a> believe, is the <a href="object.htm">object</a>ion<br/>
fairly stated.<br/>
<br/>
To begin with, such an <a href="object.htm">object</a>ion belongs to the category of arguments<br/>
which try to justify the State, the Penal <a href="law.htm">Law</a>, the Judge, and the<br/>
Gaoler.<br/>
<br/>
"As there are people, a feeble minority, who will not submit to social<br/>
<a href="cust.htm">cust</a>oms," the authoritarians say, "<a href="we.htm">we</a> <a href="must.htm">must</a> maintain magistrates,<br/>
tribunals and prisons, although these <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>itutions become a <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e of<br/>
<a href="new.htm">new</a> evils of all kinds."<br/>
<br/>
Therefore <a href="we.htm">we</a> can only repeat what <a href="we.htm">we</a> have so often said concerning<br/>
authority in general: "To avoid a possible evil you have recourse to<br/>
<a href="means.htm">means</a> which in themselves are a greater evil, and become the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e of<br/>
those same abuses that you wish to remedy. For, do not forget that it is<br/>
<a href="wage.htm">wage</a>dom, the impossibility of living otherwise than by <a href="sell.htm">sell</a>ing your<br/>
labour, which has <a href="creat.htm">creat</a>ed the present <a href="capital.htm">Capital</a>ist system, whose vices you<br/>
begin to recognize." Besides, this way of reasoning is merely a<br/>
sophistical justification of the evils of the present system. <a href="wage.htm">Wage</a>dom<br/>
was _not_ <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ituted to remove the disadvantages of <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ism; its<br/>
origin, like that of the State and private <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership, is to be found<br/>
elsewhere. It is born of slavery and serfdom imposed by force, and only<br/>
wears a more <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern garb. Thus the argument in favour of <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>dom is as<br/>
<a href="valu.htm">valu</a>eless as those by which they seek to apologize for private <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty<br/>
and the State.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> are, ne<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>heless, going to examine the <a href="object.htm">object</a>ion, and see if there<br/>
is any truth in it.<br/>
<br/>
First of all,--Is it not evident that if a society, founded on the<br/>
principle of <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a>, were really menaced by loafers, it could <a href="protect.htm">protect</a><br/>
itself without the authoritarian <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization <a href="we.htm">we</a> have nowadays, and<br/>
without having recourse to <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>dom?<br/>
<br/>
Let <a href="us.htm">us</a> take a <a href="group.htm">group</a> of volunteers, combining for some particular<br/>
enterprise. Having its success at heart, they all <a href="work.htm">work</a> with a will, save<br/>
one of the associates, who is frequently absent from his post. <a href="must.htm">Must</a> they<br/>
on his account dis<a href="solv.htm">solv</a>e the <a href="group.htm">group</a>, elect a president to impose fines,<br/>
and <a href="work.htm">work</a> out a <a href="code.htm">code</a> of penalties? It is evident that neither the one nor<br/>
the other will be done, but that some day the comrade who imperils their<br/>
enterprise will be told: "Friend, <a href="we.htm">we</a> should like to <a href="work.htm">work</a> with you; but<br/>
as you are often absent from your post, and you do your <a href="work.htm">work</a><br/>
negligently, <a href="we.htm">we</a> <a href="must.htm">must</a> part. Go and find other comrades who will put up<br/>
with your indifference!"<br/>
<br/>
This way is so natural that it is practiced everywhere, even nowadays,<br/>
in all industries, in competition with all possible systems of fines,<br/>
docking of <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>s, supervision, etc.; a <a href="work.htm">work</a>man may enter the <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>y at<br/>
the ap<a href="point.htm">point</a>ed <a href="time.htm">time</a>, but if he does his <a href="work.htm">work</a> badly, if he hinders his<br/>
comrades by his laziness or other defects, if he is quarrelsome, there<br/>
is an end of it; he is compelled to leave the <a href="work.htm">work</a>shop.<br/>
<br/>
Authoritarians pretend that it is the almighty <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>er and his<br/>
overseers who maintain regularity and quality of <a href="work.htm">work</a> in <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies. In<br/>
reality, in every somewhat complicated enterprise, in which the <a href="good.htm">good</a>s<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed <a href="pass.htm">pass</a> through many hands before being finished, it is the<br/>
<a href="factor.htm">factor</a>y itself, the <a href="work.htm">work</a>men as a unity, who see to the <a href="good.htm">good</a> quality of<br/>
the <a href="work.htm">work</a>. Therefore the best <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies of British private industry have<br/>
few overseers, far less on an average than the French <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies, and<br/>
less than the British State <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies.<br/>
<br/>
A certain standard of public morals is maintained in the same way.<br/>
Authoritarians say it is due to rural guards, judges, and policemen,<br/>
whereas in reality it is maintained _in spite_ of judges, policemen, and<br/>
rural guards. "Many are the <a href="law.htm">law</a>s <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing criminals!" was said long<br/>
ago.<br/>
<br/>
Not only in industrial <a href="work.htm">work</a>shops do <a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s go on in this way; it happens<br/>
everywhere, every day, on a scale that only bookworms have as yet no<br/>
notion of. When a railway company, federated with other companies, fails<br/>
to fulfil its engagements, when its trains are <a href="late.htm">late</a> and <a href="good.htm">good</a>s lie<br/>
neglected at the stations, the other companies threaten to cancel the<br/>
contract, and that threat usually suffices.<br/>
<br/>
It is generally believed, at any rate it is taught in State-approved<br/>
schools, that <a href="commer.htm">commer</a>ce only keeps to its engagements from fear of<br/>
<a href="law.htm">law</a>suits. No<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> of the <a href="sort.htm">sort</a>; nine <a href="time.htm">time</a>s in ten the <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>er who has not<br/>
kept his <a href="word.htm">word</a> will not appear before a judge. There, where <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e is very<br/>
<a href="act.htm">act</a>ive, as in London, the sole fact of having driven a creditor to bring<br/>
a <a href="law.htm">law</a>suit suffices for the immense majority of merchants to refuse for<br/>
<a href="good.htm">good</a> to have any dealings with a man who has compelled one of them to go<br/>
to <a href="law.htm">law</a>.<br/>
<br/>
This being so, why should <a href="means.htm">means</a> that are <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to-day among <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers in<br/>
the <a href="work.htm">work</a>shop, <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ers in the <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e, and railway companies in the<br/>
<a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization of <a href="trans.htm">trans</a><a href="port.htm">port</a>, not be made <a href="use.htm">use</a> of in a society based on<br/>
voluntary <a href="work.htm">work</a>?<br/>
<br/>
Take, for example, an association stipulating that each of its members<br/>
should <a href="carry.htm">carry</a> out the following contract: "<a href="we.htm">We</a> undertake to give you the<br/>
<a href="use.htm">use</a> of <a href="our.htm">our</a> houses, stores, streets, <a href="means.htm">means</a> of <a href="trans.htm">trans</a><a href="port.htm">port</a>, schools,<br/>
museums, etc., on condition that, from twenty to forty-five or fifty<br/>
years of age, you consecrate four or five hours a day to some <a href="work.htm">work</a><br/>
recognized as necessary to existence. Choose yourself the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing<br/>
<a href="group.htm">group</a>s which you wish to <a href="join.htm">join</a>, or <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nize a <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="group.htm">group</a>, provided that it<br/>
will undertake to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e necessaries. And as for the remainder of your<br/>
<a href="time.htm">time</a>, combine together with whomsoever you like, for re<a href="creat.htm">creat</a>ion, art, or<br/>
science, according to the bent of your taste.<br/>
<br/>
"Twelve or fifteen hundred hours of <a href="work.htm">work</a> a year, in one of the <a href="group.htm">group</a>s<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing <a href="food.htm">food</a>, <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>es, or houses, or <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ed in public <a href="sani.htm">sani</a>tation,<br/>
<a href="trans.htm">trans</a><a href="port.htm">port</a>, and so on, is all <a href="we.htm">we</a> ask of you. For this amount of <a href="work.htm">work</a> <a href="we.htm">we</a><br/>
guarantee to you the <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="use.htm">use</a> of all that these <a href="group.htm">group</a>s <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e, or will<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e. But if not one, of the thousands of <a href="group.htm">group</a>s of <a href="our.htm">our</a> federation,<br/>
will receive you, whatever be their motive; if you are ab<a href="solu.htm">solu</a>tely<br/>
incapable of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing any<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> <a href="use.htm">use</a>ful, or if you refuse to do it, then<br/>
live like an iso<a href="late.htm">late</a>d man or like an invalid. If <a href="we.htm">we</a> are rich enough to<br/>
give you the necessaries of life <a href="we.htm">we</a> shall be delighted to give them to<br/>
you. You are a man, and you have the right to live. But as you wish to<br/>
live under special conditions, and leave the ranks, it is more than<br/>
probable that you will suffer for it in your daily relations with other<br/>
citizens. You will be looked upon as a ghost of bourgeois society,<br/>
unless some friends of yours, discovering you to be a talent, kindly<br/>
<a href="free.htm">free</a> you from all moral obligation towards society by doing all the<br/>
necessary <a href="work.htm">work</a> for you.<br/>
<br/>
"And finally, if it does not please you, go and look for other<br/>
conditions elsewhere in the wide world, or else seek adhe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>s and<br/>
<a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nize with them on novel principles. <a href="we.htm">We</a> prefer <a href="our.htm">our</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>."<br/>
<br/>
This is what could be done in a <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>al society in order to turn away<br/>
sluggards if they became too numerous.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
IV<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> very much doubt that <a href="we.htm">we</a> <a href="need.htm">need</a> fear this contingency in a society<br/>
really based on the entire <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom of the individual.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, in spite of the premium on idleness offered by the private<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>, the really lazy man is comparatively rare, unless<br/>
his laziness be due to illness.<br/>
<br/>
Among <a href="work.htm">work</a>men it is often said that the bourgeois are idlers. There are<br/>
certainly enough of them, but they, too, are the exception. On the<br/>
contrary, in every industrial enterprise, you are sure to find one or<br/>
more bourgeois who <a href="work.htm">work</a> very hard. It is true that the majority of<br/>
bourgeois <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> by their privileged position to award themselves the<br/>
least unpleasant tasks, and that they <a href="work.htm">work</a> under hygienic conditions of<br/>
air, <a href="food.htm">food</a>, etc., which permits them to do their business without too<br/>
much fatigue. But these are precisely the conditions which <a href="we.htm">we</a> claim for<br/>
all <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers, without exception.<br/>
<br/>
It <a href="must.htm">must</a> also be said that if, thanks to their privileged position, rich<br/>
people often perform ab<a href="solu.htm">solu</a>tely <a href="use.htm">use</a>less or even harmful <a href="work.htm">work</a> in society,<br/>
ne<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>heless the Ministers, Heads of Departments, <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>y <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers,<br/>
<a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ers, bankers, etc., subject themselves for a number of hours every<br/>
day to <a href="work.htm">work</a> which they find more or less tiresome, all preferring their<br/>
hours of leisure to this obligatory <a href="work.htm">work</a>. And if in nine cases out of<br/>
ten this <a href="work.htm">work</a> is a harmful <a href="work.htm">work</a>, they find it none the less tiring for<br/>
that. But it is precisely because the middle <a href="class.htm">class</a> put forth a great<br/>
energy, even in doing harm <small>(knowingly or not)</small> and defending their<br/>
privileged position, that they have succeeded in defeating the <a href="land.htm">land</a>ed<br/>
nobility, and that they continue to rule the masses. If they were<br/>
idlers, they would long since have ceased to exist, and would have<br/>
disappeared like the aristocracy. In a society that would expect only<br/>
four or five hours a day of <a href="use.htm">use</a>ful, pleasant, and hygienic <a href="work.htm">work</a>, these<br/>
same middle-<a href="class.htm">class</a> people would perform their task perfectly well, and<br/>
they certainly would not put up with the horrible conditions in which<br/>
men toil nowadays without reforming them. If a Huxley spent only five<br/>
hours in the sewers of London, rest <a href="assur.htm">assur</a>ed that he would have found the<br/>
<a href="means.htm">means</a> of making them as <a href="sani.htm">sani</a>tary as his <a href="phys.htm">phys</a>iological <a href="labor.htm">labor</a>atory.<br/>
<br/>
As to the laziness of the great majority of <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers, only philistine<br/>
<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omists and philanthropists can utter such nonsense.<br/>
<br/>
If you ask an intelligent manufacturer, he will tell you that if <a href="work.htm">work</a>men<br/>
only put it into their heads to be lazy, all <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies would have to be<br/>
closed, for no measure of severity, no system of spying would be of any<br/>
<a href="use.htm">use</a>. You should have seen the terror caused in 1887 among British<br/>
<a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ers when a few agitators <a href="star.htm">star</a>ted preaching the "_go-canny_"<br/>
theory--"Bad <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>, bad <a href="work.htm">work</a>"; "Take it easy, do not over<a href="work.htm">work</a> yourselves,<br/>
and waste all you can."--"They demoralize the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er, they <a href="want.htm">want</a> to kill<br/>
<a href="our.htm">our</a> industry!" cried those same people who the day before inveighed<br/>
aga<a href="inst.htm">inst</a> the immorality of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er and the bad quality of his <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
But if the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers were what they are represented to be--<a href="name.htm">name</a>ly, the<br/>
idler whom the <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>er is supposed continually to threaten with<br/>
dismissal from the <a href="work.htm">work</a>shop--what would the <a href="word.htm">word</a> "demoralization"<br/>
signify?<br/>
<br/>
So when <a href="we.htm">we</a> speak of possible idlers, <a href="we.htm">we</a> <a href="must.htm">must</a> well understand that it is<br/>
a question of a small minority in society; and before legislating for<br/>
that minority, would it not be wise to study the origin of that<br/>
idleness? Whoever ob<a href="serv.htm">serv</a>es with an intelligent eye, sees well enough<br/>
that the child reputed lazy at school is often the one which simply does<br/>
not understand, because he is being badly taught. Very often, too, it is<br/>
suffering from cerebral anæmia, caused by po<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>y and an anti-hygienic<br/>
education. A boy who is lazy at Greek or Latin would <a href="work.htm">work</a> admirably were<br/>
he taught science, especially if he were taught with the aid of manual<br/>
labour. A girl who is stupid at mathematics becomes the first<br/>
mathematician of her <a href="class.htm">class</a> if she by chance meets somebody who can<br/>
explain to her the elements of arithmetic which she did not understand.<br/>
And a <a href="work.htm">work</a>man, lazy in the <a href="work.htm">work</a>shop, cultivates his garden at dawn,<br/>
while gazing at the rising <a href="sun.htm">sun</a>, and will be at <a href="work.htm">work</a> again at nightfall,<br/>
when all nature goes to its rest.<br/>
<br/>
Somebody has said that dust is <a href="matt.htm">matt</a>er in the wrong place. The same<br/>
definition applies to nine-tenths of those called lazy. They are people<br/>
gone astray in a direction that does not answer to their temperament nor<br/>
to their capacities. In reading the biography of great men, <a href="we.htm">we</a> are<br/>
struck with the number of "idlers" among them. They were lazy so long as<br/>
they had not found the right path; afterwards they became <a href="labor.htm">labor</a>ious to<br/>
excess. Darwin, Stephenson, and many others belonged to this category of<br/>
idlers.<br/>
<br/>
Very often the idler is but a man to whom it is repugnant to spend all<br/>
his life making the eighteenth part of a pin, or the hundredth part of a<br/>
watch, while he feels he has exuberant energy which he would like to<br/>
expend elsewhere. Often, too, he is a rebel who cannot submit to being<br/>
fixed all his life to a <a href="work.htm">work</a>-bench in order to procure a thousand<br/>
pleasures for his <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>er, while knowing himself to be far the less<br/>
stupid of the two, and knowing his only fault to be that of having been<br/>
born in a hovel <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ead of coming into the world in a castle.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, an immense number of "idlers" are idlers because they do not<br/>
know well enough the <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e by which they are compelled to earn their<br/>
living. Seeing the imperfect <a href="thing.htm">thing</a> they <a href="make.htm">make</a> with their <a href="own.htm">own</a> hands,<br/>
striving vainly to do better, and perceiving that they never will<br/>
succeed on account of the bad habits of <a href="work.htm">work</a> already acquired, they<br/>
begin to hate their <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e, and, not knowing any other, hate <a href="work.htm">work</a> in<br/>
general. Thousands of <a href="work.htm">work</a>men and artists who are failures suffer from<br/>
this cause.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, he who since his youth has learned to play the piano<br/>
_well_, to handle the <a href="plan.htm">plan</a>e _well_, the chisel, the brush, or the file,<br/>
so that he feels that what he does is _beautiful_, will never give up<br/>
the piano, the chisel, or the file. He will find pleasure in his <a href="work.htm">work</a><br/>
which does not tire him, so long as he is not overdriven.<br/>
<br/>
Under the one <a href="name.htm">name</a>, _idleness_, a series of results due to diffe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a><br/>
causes have been <a href="group.htm">group</a>ed, of which each one could be a <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e of <a href="good.htm">good</a>,<br/>
<a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ead of being a <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e of evil to society. Like all questions<br/>
concerning criminality and re<a href="late.htm">late</a>d to human faculties, facts have been<br/>
collected having no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> in <a href="common.htm">common</a> with one another. People speak of<br/>
laziness or crime, without giving themselves the trouble to analyze the<br/>
cause. They are in a hurry to punish these faults without inquiring if<br/>
the punishment itself does not contain a premium on "laziness" or<br/>
"crime."<small>[9]</small><br/>
<br/>
This is why a <a href="free.htm">free</a> society, if it saw the number of idlers increasing in<br/>
its midst, would no doubt think of looking first for the _cause_ of<br/>
laziness, in order to suppress it, before having recourse to punishment.<br/>
When it is a case, as <a href="we.htm">we</a> have already mentioned, of simple<br/>
bloodlessness, then before stuffing the brain of a child with science,<br/>
nourish his system so as to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e blood, strengthen him, and, that he<br/>
shall not waste his <a href="time.htm">time</a>, take him to the country or to the seaside;<br/>
there, teach him in the <a href="open.htm">open</a> air, not in books--geometry, by measuring<br/>
the distance to a spire, or the height of a tree; natural sciences,<br/>
while picking flowers and <a href="fish.htm">fish</a>ing in the sea; <a href="phys.htm">phys</a>ical science, while<br/>
building the boat he will go to <a href="fish.htm">fish</a> in. But for mercy's sake do not<br/>
fill his brain with <a href="class.htm">class</a>ical sentences and dead <a href="lang.htm">lang</a>uages. Do not <a href="make.htm">make</a><br/>
an idler of him!...<br/>
<br/>
Or, here is a child which has neither order nor regular habits. Let the<br/>
children first inculcate order among themselves, and <a href="late.htm">late</a>r on, the<br/>
<a href="labor.htm">labor</a>atory, the <a href="work.htm">work</a>shop, the <a href="work.htm">work</a> that will have to be done in a<br/>
limited space, with many tools about, under the guidance of an<br/>
intelligent teacher, will teach them method. But do not <a href="make.htm">make</a> disorderly<br/>
beings out of them by your school, whose only order is the symmetry of<br/>
its benches, and which--true image of the chaos in its teachings--will<br/>
never inspire anybody with the love of harmony, of consistency, and<br/>
method in <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Do not you see that by your methods of teaching, framed by a Ministry<br/>
for eight million scholars, who represent eight million diffe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a><br/>
capacities, you only impose a system <a href="good.htm">good</a> for mediocrities, conceived by<br/>
an average of mediocrities? Your school becomes a University of<br/>
laziness, as your prison is a University of crime. <a href="make.htm">Make</a> the school <a href="free.htm">free</a>,<br/>
abolish your University grades, appeal to the volunteers of teaching;<br/>
begin that way, <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ead of making <a href="law.htm">law</a>s aga<a href="inst.htm">inst</a> laziness which only <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>e<br/>
to increase it.<br/>
<br/>
Give the <a href="work.htm">work</a>man who cannot condemn himself to <a href="make.htm">make</a> all his life a<br/>
minute particle of some <a href="object.htm">object</a>, who is stifled at his little tapping<br/>
machine, which he ends by loa<a href="thing.htm">thing</a>, give him the chance of tilling the<br/>
soil, of felling trees in the forest, sailing the seas in the teeth of a<br/>
storm, dashing through space on an engine, but do not <a href="make.htm">make</a> an idler of<br/>
him by forcing him all his life to attend to a small machine, to plough<br/>
the head of a screw, or to drill the eye of a <a href="need.htm">need</a>le.<br/>
<br/>
Suppress the cause of idleness, and you may take it for granted that few<br/>
individuals will really hate <a href="work.htm">work</a>, especially voluntary <a href="work.htm">work</a>, and that<br/>
there will be no <a href="need.htm">need</a> to manufacture a <a href="code.htm">code</a> of <a href="law.htm">law</a>s on their account.<br/>

CHAPTER XIII<br/>
<br/>
THE COLLECTIVIST <a href="wage.htm">WAGE</a>S SYSTEM<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I<br/>
<br/>
In their <a href="plan.htm">plan</a>s for the r<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>struction of society the collectivists<br/>
<a href="commit.htm">commit</a>, in <a href="our.htm">our</a> opinion, a twofold error. While speaking of abolishing<br/>
<a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ist rule, they intend ne<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>heless to retain two <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>itutions<br/>
which are the very basis of this rule--Representative Government and the<br/>
<a href="wage.htm">Wage</a>s' System.<br/>
<br/>
As regards so-called representative government, <a href="we.htm">we</a> have often spoken<br/>
about it. It is ab<a href="solu.htm">solu</a>tely incomprehensible to <a href="us.htm">us</a> that intelligent<br/>
men--and such are not <a href="want.htm">want</a>ing in the collectivist party--can remain<br/>
partisans of national or municipal parliaments after all the lessons<br/>
history has given them--in France, in Eng<a href="land.htm">land</a>, in Germany, or in the<br/>
United States.<br/>
<br/>
While <a href="we.htm">we</a> see parliamentary rule breaking up, and from all sides<br/>
criticism of this rule <a href="grow.htm">grow</a>ing louder--not only of its results, but also<br/>
of _its principles_--how is it that the revolutionary socialists defend<br/>
a system already condemned to die?<br/>
<br/>
Built up by the middle <a href="class.htm">class</a>es to <a href="hold.htm">hold</a> their <a href="own.htm">own</a> aga<a href="inst.htm">inst</a> royalty,<br/>
sanctioning, and, at the same <a href="time.htm">time</a> strengthening, their sway over the<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>ers, parliamentary rule is pre-eminently a middle-<a href="class.htm">class</a> rule. The<br/>
up<a href="hold.htm">hold</a>ers of this system have never seriously maintained that a<br/>
parliament or a municipal council represent a nation or a city. The most<br/>
intelligent among them know that this is impossible. The middle <a href="class.htm">class</a>es<br/>
have simply <a href="use.htm">use</a>d the parliamentary system to raise a <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ing <a href="barrier.htm">barrier</a><br/>
aga<a href="inst.htm">inst</a> the pretensions of royalty, without giving the people liberty.<br/>
But gradually, as the people become conscious of their real <a href="interest.htm">interest</a>s,<br/>
and the variety of their <a href="interest.htm">interest</a>s is <a href="grow.htm">grow</a>ing, the system can no longer<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>. Therefore democrats of all countries vainly imagine various<br/>
palliatives. The _Referendum_ is tried and found to be a failure;<br/>
pro<a href="port.htm">port</a>ional representation is spoken of, the representation of<br/>
minorities, and other parliamentary Utopias. In a <a href="word.htm">word</a>, they strive to<br/>
find what is not to be found, and after each <a href="new.htm">new</a> experiment they are<br/>
bound to recognize that it was a failure; so that confidence in<br/>
Representative Government vanishes more and more.<br/>
<br/>
It is the same with the <a href="wage.htm">Wage</a>s' system; because, once the abolition of<br/>
private <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty is proclaimed, and the possession in <a href="common.htm">common</a> of all<br/>
<a href="means.htm">means</a> of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion is introduced,--how can the <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>s' system be<br/>
maintained in any form? This is, ne<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>heless, what collectivists are<br/>
doing when they recommend the <a href="use.htm">use</a> of the _labour-cheques_ as a <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>e of<br/>
remuneration for labour accomplished for the great Collectivist<br/>
<a href="employ.htm">employ</a>er--the State.<br/>
<br/>
It is easy to understand why the <a href="early.htm">early</a> English socialists, since the<br/>
<a href="time.htm">time</a> of Robert Owen, came to the system of labour-cheques. They simply<br/>
tried to <a href="make.htm">make</a> <a href="capital.htm">Capital</a> and Labour <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>. They repudiated the idea of<br/>
laying hands on <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ist <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty by <a href="means.htm">means</a> of revolutionary measures.<br/>
<br/>
It is also easy to understand why Proudhon took up <a href="late.htm">late</a>r on the same<br/>
idea. In his Mutualist system he tried to <a href="make.htm">make</a> <a href="capital.htm">Capital</a> less offensive,<br/>
notwithstanding the retaining of private <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty, which he detested<br/>
from the <a href="bot.htm">bot</a>tom of his heart, but which he believed to be necessary to<br/>
guarantee individuals aga<a href="inst.htm">inst</a> the State.<br/>
<br/>
Neither is it astonishing that certain <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omists, more or less<br/>
bourgeois, admit labour-cheques. They care little whether the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er is<br/>
<a href="paid.htm">paid</a> in labour-<a href="note.htm">note</a>s or in <a href="coin.htm">coin</a> stamped with the effigy of the Republic<br/>
or the Empire. They only care to save from destruction the individual<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of dwelling-houses, of <a href="land.htm">land</a>, of <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies; in any case--that,<br/>
at least, of dwelling-houses and the <a href="capital.htm">capital</a> that is necessary for<br/>
manufacturing. And labour-<a href="note.htm">note</a>s would just answer the purpose of<br/>
up<a href="hold.htm">hold</a>ing this private <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty.<br/>
<br/>
As long as labour-<a href="note.htm">note</a>s can be <a href="exch.htm">exch</a>anged for jewels or carriages, the<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a>er of the house will willingly accept them for <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>. And as long as<br/>
dwelling houses, fields, and <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies belong to iso<a href="late.htm">late</a>d <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers, men<br/>
will have to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> these <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers, in one way or another, for being allowed<br/>
to <a href="work.htm">work</a> in the fields or <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies, or for living in the houses. The<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers will <a href="agree.htm">agree</a> to be <a href="paid.htm">paid</a> by the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers in <a href="gold.htm">gold</a>, in paper-<a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y, or<br/>
in cheques <a href="exch.htm">exch</a>angeable for all <a href="sort.htm">sort</a>s of commodities, once that toll<br/>
upon labour is maintained, and the right to levy it is left with them.<br/>
But how can <a href="we.htm">we</a> defend labour-<a href="note.htm">note</a>s, this <a href="new.htm">new</a> form of <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>dom, when <a href="we.htm">we</a><br/>
admit that the houses, the fields, and the <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies will no longer be<br/>
private <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty,--that they will belong to the <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>e or the nation?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
II<br/>
<br/>
Let <a href="us.htm">us</a> closely examine this system of remuneration for <a href="work.htm">work</a> done,<br/>
preached by the French, German, English, and Italian collectivists <small>(the<br/>
Spanish anarchists, who still call themselves collectivists, imply by<br/>
Collectivism the possession in <a href="common.htm">common</a> of all <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ruments of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion,<br/>
and the "liberty of each <a href="group.htm">group</a> to divide the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e, as they think fit,<br/>
according to <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ist or any other principles")</small>.<br/>
<br/>
It amounts to this: Everybody <a href="work.htm">work</a>s in field, <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>y, school, hospital,<br/>
etc. The <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing-day is fixed by the State, which <a href="own.htm">own</a>s the <a href="land.htm">land</a>, the<br/>
<a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies, the roads, etc. Every <a href="work.htm">work</a>-day is <a href="paid.htm">paid</a> for with a<br/>
_labour-<a href="note.htm">note</a>_, which is inscribed with these <a href="word.htm">word</a>s: _Eight hours' <a href="work.htm">work</a>_.<br/>
With this cheque the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er can procure all <a href="sort.htm">sort</a>s of merchandise in the<br/>
stores <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by the State or by divers corporations. The cheque is<br/>
divisible, so that you can <a href="buy.htm">buy</a> an hour's-<a href="work.htm">work</a> <a href="worth.htm">worth</a> of meat, ten<br/>
minutes' <a href="worth.htm">worth</a> of matches, or half an hour of tobacco. After the<br/>
Collectivist Revolution, <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ead of saying "tw<a href="open.htm">open</a>ce <a href="worth.htm">worth</a> of <a href="soap.htm">soap</a>," <a href="we.htm">we</a><br/>
shall say "five minutes' <a href="worth.htm">worth</a> of <a href="soap.htm">soap</a>."<br/>
<br/>
Most collectivists, true to the distinction laid down by middle-<a href="class.htm">class</a><br/>
<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omists <small>(and by Marx as well)</small> between _qualified_ <a href="work.htm">work</a> and _simple_<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>, tell <a href="us.htm">us</a>, moreover, that _qualified_ or professional <a href="work.htm">work</a> <a href="must.htm">must</a> be<br/>
<a href="paid.htm">paid</a> a certain quantity more than _simple_ <a href="work.htm">work</a>. Thus one hour's <a href="work.htm">work</a> of<br/>
a doctor will have to be considered as equivalent to two or three hours'<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a> of a hospital nurse, or to three or five hours' <a href="work.htm">work</a> of a navvy.<br/>
"Professional, or qualified <a href="work.htm">work</a>, will be a multiple of simple <a href="work.htm">work</a>,"<br/>
says the collectivist Grönlund, "because this kind of <a href="work.htm">work</a> <a href="need.htm">need</a>s a more<br/>
or less long app<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>iceship."<br/>
<br/>
Some other collectivists, such as the French Marxist, Guesde, do not<br/>
<a href="make.htm">make</a> this distinction. They proclaim the "Equality of <a href="wage.htm">Wage</a>s." The<br/>
doctor, the schoolmaster, and the professor will be <a href="paid.htm">paid</a> <small>(in<br/>
labour-cheques)</small> at the same rate as the navvy. Eight hours visiting the<br/>
sick in a hospital will be <a href="worth.htm">worth</a> the same as eight hours spent in<br/>
earth<a href="work.htm">work</a>s or else in mines or <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies.<br/>
<br/>
Some <a href="make.htm">make</a> a greater concession; they admit that dis<a href="agree.htm">agree</a>able or<br/>
un<a href="heal.htm">heal</a>thy <a href="work.htm">work</a>--such as sewerage--could be <a href="paid.htm">paid</a> for at a higher rate<br/>
than <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>able <a href="work.htm">work</a>. One hour's <a href="work.htm">work</a> of a sewerman would be <a href="worth.htm">worth</a>, they<br/>
say, two hours of a professor's <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Let <a href="us.htm">us</a> add that certain collectivists admit of corporations being <a href="paid.htm">paid</a> a<br/>
lump sum for <a href="work.htm">work</a> done. Thus a corporation would say: "Here are a<br/>
hundred tons of steel. A hundred <a href="work.htm">work</a>men were required to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e them,<br/>
and it took them ten days. Their <a href="work.htm">work</a>-day being an eight-hours day, it<br/>
has taken them eight thousand <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing hours to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e a hundred tons of<br/>
steel--eight hours a ton." For this the State would <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> them eight<br/>
thousand labour-<a href="note.htm">note</a>s of one hour each, and these eight thousand cheques<br/>
would be divided among the members of the iron-<a href="work.htm">work</a>s as they themselves<br/>
thought <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, a hundred miners having taken twenty days to extract<br/>
eight thousand tons of coal, coal would be <a href="worth.htm">worth</a> two hours a ton, and<br/>
the sixteen thousand cheques of one hour each, received by the Guild of<br/>
Miners, would be divided among their members according to their <a href="own.htm">own</a><br/>
appreciation.<br/>
<br/>
If the miners protested and said that a ton of steel should only <a href="cost.htm">cost</a><br/>
six hours' <a href="work.htm">work</a> <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ead of eight; if the professor wished to have his<br/>
day <a href="paid.htm">paid</a> four <a href="time.htm">time</a>s more than the nurse, then the State would interfere<br/>
and would settle their differences.<br/>
<br/>
Such is, in a few <a href="word.htm">word</a>s, the <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization the collectivists wish to see<br/>
arise out of the Social Revolution. As <a href="we.htm">we</a> see, their principles are:<br/>
Collective <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty of the <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ruments of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, and remuneration<br/>
to each according to the <a href="time.htm">time</a> spent in <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing, while taking into<br/>
account the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tivity of his labour. As to the political system, it<br/>
would be the Parliamentary system, <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified by _positive <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ructions_<br/>
given to those elected, and by the _Referendum_--a vote, taken by _noes_<br/>
or _ayes_ by the nation.<br/>
<br/>
Let <a href="us.htm">us</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a> that this system appears to <a href="us.htm">us</a> simply unrealizable.<br/>
<br/>
Collectivists begin by proclaiming a revolutionary principle--the<br/>
abolition of private <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty--and then they deny it, no sooner than<br/>
proclaimed, by up<a href="hold.htm">hold</a>ing an <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>ption<br/>
which originated in private <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty.<br/>
<br/>
They proclaim a revolutionary principle, and ignore the consequences<br/>
that this principle will inevitably bring about. They forget that the<br/>
very fact of abolishing individual <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty in the <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ruments of<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>--<a href="land.htm">land</a>, <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies, road, <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>--<a href="must.htm">must</a> launch society into<br/>
ab<a href="solu.htm">solu</a>tely <a href="new.htm">new</a> channels; <a href="must.htm">must</a> completely o<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>hrow the present system of<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, <a href="bot.htm">bot</a>h in its aim as well as in its <a href="means.htm">means</a>; <a href="must.htm">must</a> <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify daily<br/>
relations between individuals, as soon as <a href="land.htm">land</a>, machinery, and all other<br/>
<a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ruments of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion are considered <a href="common.htm">common</a> <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty.<br/>
<br/>
They say, "No private <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty," and im<a href="media.htm">media</a>tely after strive to<br/>
maintain private <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty in its daily manifestations. "You shall be a<br/>
<a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>e as far as regards <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion: fields, tools, machinery, all that<br/>
has been invented up till now--<a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies, railways, harbours, mines,<br/>
etc., all are yours. Not the slightest distinction will be made<br/>
concerning the <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e of each in this collective <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty.<br/>
<br/>
"But from to-morrow you will minutely debate the <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e you are going to<br/>
take in the <a href="creat.htm">creat</a>ion of <a href="new.htm">new</a> machinery, in the digging of <a href="new.htm">new</a> mines. You<br/>
will carefully weigh what part of the <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e belongs to you. You<br/>
will count your minutes of <a href="work.htm">work</a>, and you will take care that a minute of<br/>
your neighbours should not <a href="buy.htm">buy</a> more than yours.<br/>
<br/>
"And as an hour measures no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a>, as in some <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies a <a href="work.htm">work</a>er can see<br/>
to six power-looms at a <a href="time.htm">time</a>, while in another he only tends two, you<br/>
will weigh the muscular force, the brain energy, and the nervous energy<br/>
you have expended. You will accurately calcu<a href="late.htm">late</a> the years of<br/>
app<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>iceship in order to appraise the amount each will contribute to<br/>
<a href="future.htm">future</a> <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion. And this--after having declared that you do not take<br/>
into account his <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e in _<a href="past.htm">past</a>_ <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion."<br/>
<br/>
Well, for <a href="us.htm">us</a> it is evident that a society cannot be based on two<br/>
ab<a href="solu.htm">solu</a>tely opposed principles, two principles that con<a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ict one<br/>
another continually. And a nation or a <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>e which would have such an<br/>
<a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization would be compelled to re<a href="vert.htm">vert</a> to private <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty in the<br/>
<a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ruments of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, or to <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>form itself into a <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ist<br/>
society.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
III<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> have said that certain collectivist writers desire that a distinction<br/>
should be made between _qualified_ or professional <a href="work.htm">work</a> and _simple_<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>. They pretend that an hour's <a href="work.htm">work</a> of an engineer, an architect, or<br/>
a doctor, <a href="must.htm">must</a> be considered as two or three hours' <a href="work.htm">work</a> of a<br/>
blacksmith, a mason, or a hospital nurse. And the same distinction <a href="must.htm">must</a><br/>
be made between all <a href="sort.htm">sort</a>s of <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>es necessitating app<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>iceship, and<br/>
the simple toil of day labourers.<br/>
<br/>
Well, to establish this distinction would be to maintain all the<br/>
inequalities of present society. It would mean fixing a dividing line,<br/>
from the beginning, between the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers and those who pretend to govern<br/>
them. It would mean dividing society into two very distinct <a href="class.htm">class</a>es--the<br/>
aristocracy of knowledge placed above the horny-handed lower orders--the<br/>
one doomed to <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>e the other; the one <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing with its hands to feed<br/>
and <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>e those who, <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>ing by their leisure, study how to govern<br/>
their fosterers.<br/>
<br/>
It would mean reviving one of the distinct peculiarities of present<br/>
society and giving it the sanction of the Social Revolution. It would<br/>
mean setting up as a principle an abuse already condemned in <a href="our.htm">our</a> ancient<br/>
crumbling society.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> know the answer <a href="we.htm">we</a> shall get. They will speak of "Scientific<br/>
Socialism"; they will quote bourgeois <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omists, and Marx too, to prove<br/>
that a scale of <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>s has its _raison d'être_, as "the labour force" of<br/>
the engineer will have <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> more to society than the "labour-force" of<br/>
the navvy. In fact--have not <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omists tried to prove to <a href="us.htm">us</a> that if an<br/>
engineer is <a href="paid.htm">paid</a> twenty <a href="time.htm">time</a>s more than a navvy it is _because_ the<br/>
"necessary" outlay to <a href="make.htm">make</a> an engineer is greater than that necessary to<br/>
<a href="make.htm">make</a> a navvy? And has not Marx asserted that the same distinction is<br/>
equally logical between two branches of manual labour? He could not<br/>
conclude otherwise, having taken up on his <a href="own.htm">own</a> account Ricardo's theory<br/>
of <a href="valu.htm">valu</a>e, and upheld that <a href="good.htm">good</a>s _are_ <a href="exch.htm">exch</a>anged in pro<a href="port.htm">port</a>ion to the<br/>
quantity of <a href="work.htm">work</a> socially necessary for their <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
But <a href="we.htm">we</a> know what to think of this. <a href="we.htm">We</a> know that if engineers,<br/>
scientists, or doctors are <a href="paid.htm">paid</a> ten or a hundred <a href="time.htm">time</a>s more than a<br/>
labourer, and if a weaver earns three <a href="time.htm">time</a>s more than an <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>cultural<br/>
labourer, and ten <a href="time.htm">time</a>s more than a girl in a match <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>y, it is not<br/>
by reason of their "<a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion," but by reason of a monopoly of<br/>
education, or a monopoly of industry. Engineers, scientists, and doctors<br/>
merely exploit their <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>--their diplomas--as middle-<a href="class.htm">class</a> <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ers<br/>
exploit a <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>y, or as nobles <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to exploit their titles of<br/>
nobility.<br/>
<br/>
As to the <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>er who <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s an engineer twenty <a href="time.htm">time</a>s more than a<br/>
labourer, it is simply due to <a href="person.htm">person</a>al <a href="interest.htm">interest</a>; if the engineer can<br/>
<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omize £4,000 a year on the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, the <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>er <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s him<br/>
£800. And if the <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>er has a foreman who saves £400 on the <a href="work.htm">work</a> by<br/>
cleverly sweating <a href="work.htm">work</a>men, he gladly gives him £80 or £120 a year. He<br/>
parts with an extra £40 when he expects to gain £400 by it; and this is<br/>
the essence of the <a href="capital.htm">Capital</a>ist system. The same differences obtain among<br/>
diffe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> manual <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
Let them, therefore, not talk to <a href="us.htm">us</a> of "the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion" which<br/>
raises the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>ed labour, and tell <a href="us.htm">us</a> that a student who has<br/>
gaily spent his youth in a university has a _right_ to a <a href="wage.htm">wage</a> ten <a href="time.htm">time</a>s<br/>
greater than the son of a miner who has <a href="grow.htm">grow</a>n pale in a mine since the<br/>
age of eleven; or that a weaver has a _right_ to a <a href="wage.htm">wage</a> three or four<br/>
<a href="time.htm">time</a>s greater than that of an <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>cultural labourer. The <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of<br/>
teaching a weaver his <a href="work.htm">work</a> is not four <a href="time.htm">time</a>s greater than the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of<br/>
teaching a peasant his. The weaver simply <a href="bene.htm">bene</a>fits by the advantages his<br/>
industry reaps in international <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e, from countries that have as yet<br/>
no industries, and in consequence of the privileges accorded by all<br/>
States to industries in preference to the tilling of the soil.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody has ever calcu<a href="late.htm">late</a>d the _<a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion_ of a <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>er; and<br/>
if a noble loafer <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s far more to society than a <a href="work.htm">work</a>er, it remains to<br/>
be seen whether a robust day-labourer does not <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> more to society than<br/>
a <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>ed artisan, when <a href="we.htm">we</a> have taken into account infant-mortality<br/>
among the poor, the ravages of anæmia, and premature deaths.<br/>
<br/>
Could they, for example, <a href="make.htm">make</a> <a href="us.htm">us</a> believe that the 1s. 3d. <a href="paid.htm">paid</a> to a<br/>
Paris <a href="work.htm">work</a>woman, the 3d. <a href="paid.htm">paid</a> to an Auvergne peasant girl who <a href="grow.htm">grow</a>s<br/>
blind at lace-making, or the 1s. 8d. <a href="paid.htm">paid</a> to the peasant represent their<br/>
"<a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion." <a href="we.htm">We</a> know full well that people <a href="work.htm">work</a> for less, but<br/>
<a href="we.htm">we</a> also know that they do so exclusively because, thanks to <a href="our.htm">our</a><br/>
wonderful <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization, they would die of hunger did they not accept<br/>
these mock <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
For <a href="us.htm">us</a> the scale of remuneration is a complex result of <a href="tax.htm">tax</a>es, of<br/>
governmental tutelage, of <a href="capital.htm">Capital</a>ist monopoly. In a <a href="word.htm">word</a>, of State and<br/>
<a href="capital.htm">Capital</a>. Therefore, <a href="we.htm">we</a> say that all <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>s' theories have been invented<br/>
after the event to justify injustices at present existing, and that <a href="we.htm">we</a><br/>
<a href="need.htm">need</a> not take them into consideration.<br/>
<br/>
Neither will they fail to tell <a href="us.htm">us</a> that the Collectivist scale of <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>s<br/>
would be an improvement. "It would be better," so they say, "to see<br/>
certain artisans receiving a <a href="wage.htm">wage</a> two or three <a href="time.htm">time</a>s higher than <a href="common.htm">common</a><br/>
labourers, than to see a minister receiving in a day what a <a href="work.htm">work</a>man<br/>
cannot earn in a year. It would be a great step towards equality."<br/>
<br/>
For <a href="us.htm">us</a> this step would be the reverse of progress. To <a href="make.htm">make</a> a distinction<br/>
between simple and professional <a href="work.htm">work</a> in a <a href="new.htm">new</a> society would result in<br/>
the Revolution sanctioning and recognizing as a principle a brutal fact<br/>
<a href="we.htm">we</a> submit to nowadays, but that <a href="we.htm">we</a> ne<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>heless find unjust. It would<br/>
mean imitating those gentlemen of the French Assembly who proclaimed on<br/>
August 4th, 1789, the abolition of feudal rights, but who on August 8th<br/>
sanctioned these same rights by imposing dues on the peasants to<br/>
compensate the noblemen, placing these dues under the <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ion of the<br/>
Revolution. It would mean imitating the Russian Government, which<br/>
proclaimed, at the <a href="time.htm">time</a> of the emancipation of the serfs, that certain<br/>
<a href="land.htm">land</a>s should henceforth belong to the nobility, while formerly these<br/>
<a href="land.htm">land</a>s were considered as belonging to the serfs.<br/>
<br/>
Or else, to take a better known example, when the <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>e of 1871<br/>
decided to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> members of the <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>e Council 12s. 6d. a day, while the<br/>
Federates on the ramparts received only 1s. 3d., this decision was<br/>
hailed as an <a href="act.htm">act</a> of superior democratic equality. In reality, the<br/>
<a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>e only ratified the former inequality between functionary and<br/>
<a href="sold.htm">sold</a>ier, Government and governed. Coming from an Op<a href="port.htm">port</a>unist Chamber of<br/>
Deputies, such a decision would have appeared admirable, but the <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>e<br/>
doomed her <a href="own.htm">own</a> revolutionary principles when she failed to put them into<br/>
practice.<br/>
<br/>
Under <a href="our.htm">our</a> existing social system, when a minister gets <a href="paid.htm">paid</a> £4,000 a<br/>
year, while a <a href="work.htm">work</a>man <a href="must.htm">must</a> content himself with £40 or less; when a<br/>
foreman is <a href="paid.htm">paid</a> two or three <a href="time.htm">time</a>s more than a <a href="work.htm">work</a>man, and among<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>men there is every gradation, from 8s. a day down to the peasant<br/>
girl's 3d., <a href="we.htm">we</a> disapprove of the high salary of the minister as well as<br/>
of the difference between the 8s. of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>man and the 3d. of the poor<br/>
woman. And <a href="we.htm">we</a> say, '"</span>Down with the privileges of education, as well as<br/>
with those of birth!" <a href="we.htm">We</a> are anarchists precisely because these<br/>
privileges revolt <a href="us.htm">us</a>.<br/>
<br/>
They revolt <a href="us.htm">us</a> already in this authoritarian society. Could <a href="we.htm">we</a> endure<br/>
them in a society that began by proclaiming equality?<br/>
<br/>
This is why some collectivists, understanding the impossibility of<br/>
maintaining a scale of <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>s in a society inspired by the breath of the<br/>
Revolution, hasten to proclaim equality of <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>. But they meet with <a href="new.htm">new</a><br/>
difficulties, and their equality of <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>s becomes the same unrealizable<br/>
Utopia as the scale of <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>s of other collectivists.<br/>
<br/>
A society having taken possession of all social wealth, having boldly<br/>
proclaimed the right of all to this wealth--whatever <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e they may have<br/>
taken in <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing it--will be compelled to abandon any system of <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>s,<br/>
whether in <a href="cur.htm">cur</a>rency or labour-<a href="note.htm">note</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
IV<br/>
<br/>
The collectivists say, "To each according to his deeds"; or, in other<br/>
<a href="term.htm">term</a>s, according to his <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e of <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ices rendered to society. They<br/>
think it expedient to put this principle into practice, as soon as the<br/>
Social Revolution will have made all <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ruments of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion <a href="common.htm">common</a><br/>
<a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty. But <a href="we.htm">we</a> think that if the Social Revolution had the misfortune<br/>
of proclaiming such a principle, it would mean its necessary failure; it<br/>
would mean leaving the social problem, which <a href="past.htm">past</a> centuries have<br/>
burdened <a href="us.htm">us</a> with, un<a href="solv.htm">solv</a>ed.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, in a society like <a href="our.htm">our</a>s, in which the more a man <a href="work.htm">work</a>s the<br/>
less he is remunerated, this principle, at first sight, may appear to be<br/>
a yearning for justice. But in reality it is only the perpetuation of<br/>
injustice. It was by proclaiming this principle that <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>dom began, to<br/>
end in the glaring inequalities and all the abominations of present<br/>
society; because, from the moment <a href="work.htm">work</a> done began to be appraised in<br/>
<a href="cur.htm">cur</a>rency, or in any other form of <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>, the day it was <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>d upon that<br/>
man would only receive the <a href="wage.htm">wage</a> he should be able to <a href="secur.htm">secur</a>e to himself,<br/>
the whole history of a State-aided <a href="capital.htm">Capital</a>ist Society was as <a href="good.htm">good</a> as<br/>
written; it was contained in germ in this principle.<br/>
<br/>
Shall <a href="we.htm">we</a>, then, <a href="return.htm">return</a> to <a href="our.htm">our</a> <a href="star.htm">star</a>ting-<a href="point.htm">point</a>, and go through the same<br/>
evolution again? <a href="our.htm">Our</a> theorists desire it, but fortunately it is<br/>
impossible. The Revolution, <a href="we.htm">we</a> maintain, <a href="must.htm">must</a> be <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ist; if not, it<br/>
will be drowned in blood, and have to be begun over again.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="serv.htm">Serv</a>ices rendered to society, be they <a href="work.htm">work</a> in <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>y or field, or<br/>
mental <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ices, _cannot be_ <a href="valu.htm">valu</a>ed in <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y. There can be no exact<br/>
measure of <a href="valu.htm">valu</a>e <small>(of what has been wrongly <a href="term.htm">term</a>ed <a href="exch.htm">exch</a>ange <a href="valu.htm">valu</a>e)</small>, nor<br/>
of <a href="use value.htm">use value</a>, in <a href="term.htm">term</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion. If two individuals <a href="work.htm">work</a> for the<br/>
<a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ity five hours a day, year in year out, at diffe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a> which is<br/>
equally <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>able to them, <a href="we.htm">we</a> may say that on the whole their labour is<br/>
approximately equivalent. But <a href="we.htm">we</a> cannot divide their <a href="work.htm">work</a>, and say that<br/>
the result of any particular day, hour, or minute of <a href="work.htm">work</a> of the one is<br/>
<a href="worth.htm">worth</a> the result of one day, one hour, or one minute of the other.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> may roughly say that the man, who during his life<a href="time.htm">time</a> has deprived<br/>
himself of leisure during ten hours a day has given far more to society<br/>
than the one who has only deprived himself of leisure during five hours<br/>
a day, or who has not deprived himself at all. But <a href="we.htm">we</a> cannot take what<br/>
he has done during two hours, and say that the yield of his two hours'<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a> is <a href="worth.htm">worth</a> twice as much as the yield of another individual, who has<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>ed only one hour, and remunerate the two in pro<a href="port.htm">port</a>ion. It would be<br/>
disregarding all that is complex in industry, in <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture, in the<br/>
whole life of present society; it would be ignoring to what extent all<br/>
individual <a href="work.htm">work</a> is the result of the <a href="past.htm">past</a> and the present labour of<br/>
society as a whole. It would mean believing <a href="our.htm">our</a>selves to be living in<br/>
the Stone Age, whereas <a href="we.htm">we</a> are living in an age of steel.<br/>
<br/>
If you enter a <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern coal-mine you will see a man in <a href="charg.htm">charg</a>e of a huge<br/>
machine that raises and lowers a cage. In his hand he <a href="hold.htm">hold</a>s a lever that<br/>
stops and reverses the course of the machine; he lowers it and the cage<br/>
reverses its course in the twinkling of an eye; he sends it upwards or<br/>
downwards into the depths of the shaft with a giddy swiftness. All<br/>
attention, he follows with his eyes fixed on an indicator which shows<br/>
him, on a small scale, at which <a href="point.htm">point</a> of the shaft the cage is at each<br/>
s<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>d of its progress; and as soon as the indicator has reached a<br/>
certain level, he suddenly stops the course of the cage, not a yard<br/>
higher nor lower than the required spot. And no sooner have the colliers<br/>
unloaded their coal-wagonettes, and pushed empty ones <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ead, than he<br/>
reverses the lever and again sends the cage back into space.<br/>
<br/>
During eight or ten consecutive hours every day he <a href="must.htm">must</a> keep the same<br/>
strain of attention. Should his brain relax for a moment, the cage would<br/>
inevitably strike aga<a href="inst.htm">inst</a> the gear, break its wheels, snap the rope,<br/>
crush men, and put a stop to all <a href="work.htm">work</a> in the mine. Should he waste three<br/>
s<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>ds at each touch of the lever,--the extraction, in <a href="our.htm">our</a> <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern,<br/>
perfected mines, would be reduced from twenty to fifty tons a day.<br/>
<br/>
Is it he who is the most necessary man in the mine? Or, is it perhaps<br/>
the boy who signals to him from below to raise the cage? Is it the miner<br/>
at the <a href="bot.htm">bot</a>tom of the shaft, who risks his life every <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ant, and who<br/>
will some day be killed by fire-damp? Or is it the engineer, who would<br/>
lose the layer of coal, and would cause the miners to dig on rock by a<br/>
simple mistake in his calculations? Or is it the mine <a href="own.htm">own</a>er who has put<br/>
his <a href="capital.htm">capital</a> into the mine, and who has perhaps, contrary to expert<br/>
advice, asserted that ex<a href="cell.htm">cell</a>ent coal would be found there?<br/>
<br/>
All those who are engaged in the mine contribute to the extraction of<br/>
coal in pro<a href="port.htm">port</a>ion to their strength, their energy, their knowledge,<br/>
their intelligence, and their <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>. And <a href="we.htm">we</a> may say that all have the<br/>
right to _live_, to satisfy their <a href="need.htm">need</a>s, and even their whims, when the<br/>
necessaries of life have been <a href="secur.htm">secur</a>ed for all. But how can <a href="we.htm">we</a> appraise<br/>
the <a href="work.htm">work</a> of each one of them?<br/>
<br/>
And, moreover, Is the coal they have extracted entirely _their_ <a href="work.htm">work</a>?<br/>
Is it not also the <a href="work.htm">work</a> of the men who have built the railway leading to<br/>
the mine and the roads that radiate from all the railway stations? Is it<br/>
not also the <a href="work.htm">work</a> of those that have tilled and sown the fields,<br/>
extracted iron, cut wood in the forests, built the machines that burn<br/>
coal, slowly <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>eloped the mining industry altogether, and so on?<br/>
<br/>
It is utterly impossible to draw a distinction between the <a href="work.htm">work</a> of each<br/>
of those men. To measure the <a href="work.htm">work</a> by its results leads <a href="us.htm">us</a> to an<br/>
absurdity; to divide the total <a href="work.htm">work</a>, and to measure its fractions by the<br/>
number of hours spent on the <a href="work.htm">work</a> also leads <a href="us.htm">us</a> to absurdity. One <a href="thing.htm">thing</a><br/>
remains: to put the _<a href="need.htm">need</a>s_ above the _<a href="work.htm">work</a>s_, and first of all to<br/>
recognize _the right to live_, and <a href="late.htm">late</a>r on _the right to well-being_<br/>
for all those who took their <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e in <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
But take any other branch of human <a href="act.htm">act</a>ivity--take the manifestations of<br/>
life as a whole. Which one of <a href="us.htm">us</a> can claim the higher remuneration for<br/>
his <a href="work.htm">work</a>? Is it the doctor who has found out the illness, or the nurse<br/>
who has brought about recovery by her hygienic care? Is it the inventor<br/>
of the first s<a href="team.htm">team</a>-engine, or the boy, who, one day getting tired of<br/>
pulling the rope that formerly <a href="open.htm">open</a>ed the valve to let s<a href="team.htm">team</a> under the<br/>
piston, tied the rope to the lever of the machine, without suspecting<br/>
that he had invented the essential mechanical part of all <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern<br/>
machinery--the <a href="auto.htm">auto</a>matic valve?<br/>
<br/>
Is it the inventor of the locomotive, or the <a href="work.htm">work</a>man of <a href="new.htm">New</a>castle, who<br/>
suggested replacing the stones formerly laid under the rails by wooden<br/>
sleepers, as the stones, for <a href="want.htm">want</a> of elasticity, caused the trains to<br/>
derail? Is it the engineer on the locomotive? The signalman who stops<br/>
the trains, or lets them <a href="pass.htm">pass</a> by? The switchman who <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>fers a train<br/>
from one line to another?<br/>
<br/>
Again, to whom do <a href="we.htm">we</a> owe the <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>atlantic cable? Is it to the<br/>
electrical engineer who obstinately affirmed that the cable would<br/>
<a href="trans.htm">trans</a>mit messages while learned men of science declared it to be<br/>
impossible? Is it to Maury, the learned <a href="phys.htm">phys</a>ical geographer, who advised<br/>
that thick cables should be set aside for others as thin as a walking<br/>
cane? Or else to those volunteers, come from nobody knows where, who<br/>
spent their days and nights on deck minutely examining every yard of the<br/>
cable, and removed the nails that the <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e<a href="hold.htm">hold</a>ers of s<a href="team.htm">team</a>ship<br/>
companies stupidly caused to be driven into the non-conducting wrapper<br/>
of the cable, so as to <a href="make.htm">make</a> it un<a href="serv.htm">serv</a>iceable?<br/>
<br/>
And in a wider sphere, the true sphere of life, with its joys, its<br/>
sufferings, and its accidents, cannot each one of <a href="us.htm">us</a> recall someone who<br/>
has rendered him so great a <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ice that <a href="we.htm">we</a> should be indignant if its<br/>
equivalent in <a href="coin.htm">coin</a> were mentioned? The <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ice may have been but a <a href="word.htm">word</a>,<br/>
no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> but a <a href="word.htm">word</a> spoken at the right <a href="time.htm">time</a>, or else it may have been<br/>
months and years of <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>otion, and <a href="we.htm">we</a> are going to appraise these<br/>
"incalculable" <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ices in "labour-<a href="note.htm">note</a>s"?<br/>
<br/>
"The <a href="work.htm">work</a>s of each!" But human society would not exist for more than two<br/>
consecutive generations if everyone did not give infinitely more than<br/>
that for which he is <a href="paid.htm">paid</a> in <a href="coin.htm">coin</a>, in "cheques," or in civic rewards.<br/>
The race would soon become extinct if mothers did not sacrifice their<br/>
lives to take care of their children, if men did not give continually,<br/>
without demanding an equivalent reward, if men did not give most<br/>
precisely when they expect no reward.<br/>
<br/>
If middle-<a href="class.htm">class</a> society is decaying, if <a href="we.htm">we</a> have got into a blind alley<br/>
from which <a href="we.htm">we</a> cannot emerge without attacking <a href="past.htm">past</a> <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>itutions with<br/>
torch and hatchet, it is precisely because <a href="we.htm">we</a> have given too much to<br/>
counting. It is because <a href="we.htm">we</a> have let <a href="our.htm">our</a>selves be influenced into<br/>
_giving_ only to _receive._ It is because <a href="we.htm">we</a> have aimed at turning<br/>
society into a <a href="commer.htm">commer</a>cial company based on _debit_ and _credit_.<br/>
<br/>
After all, the Collectivists know this themselves. They vaguely<br/>
understand that a society could not exist if it carried out the<br/>
principle of "Each according to his deeds." They have a notion that<br/>
_necessaries_--<a href="we.htm">we</a> do not speak of whims--the <a href="need.htm">need</a>s of the individual, do<br/>
not always correspond to his _<a href="work.htm">work</a>s_. Thus De Paepe tells <a href="us.htm">us</a>: "The<br/>
principle--the eminently Individualist principle--would, however, be<br/>
_tempered_ by social intervention for the education of children and<br/>
young <a href="person.htm">person</a>s <small>(including maintenance and lodging)</small>, and by the social<br/>
<a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization for assisting the infirm and the sick, for retreats for<br/>
aged <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers, etc." They understand that a man of forty, father of three<br/>
children, has other <a href="need.htm">need</a>s than a young man of twenty. They know that the<br/>
woman who suckles her infant and spends sleepless nights at its bedside,<br/>
cannot do as much _<a href="work.htm">work</a>_ as the man who has slept peacefully. They seem<br/>
to take in that men and women, worn out maybe by dint of over<a href="work.htm">work</a> for<br/>
society, may be incapable of doing as much _<a href="work.htm">work</a>_ as those who have<br/>
spent their <a href="time.htm">time</a> leisurely and pocketed their "labour-<a href="note.htm">note</a>s" in the<br/>
privileged career of State functionaries.<br/>
<br/>
They are eager to temper their principle. They say: "Society will not<br/>
fail to maintain and bring up its children; to help <a href="bot.htm">bot</a>h aged and<br/>
infirm. Without doubt _<a href="need.htm">need</a>s_ will be the measure of the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> that<br/>
society will burden itself with, to temper the principle of deeds."<br/>
<br/>
Charity, charity, always Christian charity, <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nized by the State this<br/>
<a href="time.htm">time</a>. They believe in improving the asylums for foundlings, in effecting<br/>
<a href="old.htm">old</a>-age and sick <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ances--so as to _temper_ their principle. But they<br/>
cannot yet throw aside the idea of "wounding first and <a href="heal.htm">heal</a>ing<br/>
afterwards"!<br/>
<br/>
Thus, after having denied <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ism, after having laughed at their ease<br/>
at the formula--"To each according to his <a href="need.htm">need</a>s"--these great <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omists<br/>
discover that they have forgotten some<a href="thing.htm">thing</a>, the <a href="need.htm">need</a>s of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ers,<br/>
which they now admit. Only it is for the State to estimate them, for the<br/>
State to verify if the <a href="need.htm">need</a>s are not dispro<a href="port.htm">port</a>ionate to the <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The State will dole out charity. Thence to the English poor-<a href="law.htm">law</a> and the<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>house is but a step.<br/>
<br/>
There is but a slight difference, because even this stepmother of a<br/>
society aga<a href="inst.htm">inst</a> whom <a href="we.htm">we</a> are in revolt has also been compelled to<br/>
_temper_ her individualist principles; she, too, has had to <a href="make.htm">make</a><br/>
concessions in a <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ist direction and under the same form of charity.<br/>
<br/>
She, too, distributes halfpenny dinners to prevent the pillaging of her<br/>
shops; builds hospitals--often very bad ones, but some<a href="time.htm">time</a>s splendid<br/>
ones--to prevent the ravages of contagious diseases. She, too, after<br/>
having <a href="paid.htm">paid</a> the hours of labour, <a href="shelter.htm">shelter</a>s the children of those she has<br/>
wrecked. She takes their <a href="need.htm">need</a>s into consideration and doles out charity.<br/>
<br/>
Po<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>y, <a href="we.htm">we</a> have said elsewhere, was the primary cause of wealth. It was<br/>
po<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>y that <a href="creat.htm">creat</a>ed the first <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ist; because, before accumulating<br/>
"<a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a> <a href="valu.htm">valu</a>e," of which <a href="we.htm">we</a> hear so much, men had to be sufficiently<br/>
destitute to consent to <a href="sell.htm">sell</a> their labour, so as not to die of hunger.<br/>
It was po<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>y that made <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ists. And if the number of the poor<br/>
increased so rapidly during the Middle Ages, it was due to the invasions<br/>
and wars that followed the founding of States, and to the increase of<br/>
riches resulting from the exploitation of the East. These two causes<br/>
tore asunder the bonds that kept men together in the agrarian and urban<br/>
<a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ities, and taught them to proclaim the principle of _<a href="wage.htm">wage</a>s_, so<br/>
dear to the exploiters, <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ead of the solidarity they formerly<br/>
practiced in their tribal life.<br/>
<br/>
And it is this principle that is to spring from a revolution which men<br/>
dare to call by the <a href="name.htm">name</a> of Social Revolution,--a <a href="name.htm">name</a> so dear to the<br/>
<a href="star.htm">star</a>ved, the oppressed, and the sufferers!<br/>
<br/>
It can never be. For the day on which <a href="old.htm">old</a> <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>itutions will fall under<br/>
the proletarian axe, voices will cry out: "<a href="bread.htm">Bread</a>, <a href="shelter.htm">shelter</a>, ease for<br/>
all!" And those voices will be listened to; the people will say: "Let <a href="us.htm">us</a><br/>
begin by allaying <a href="our.htm">our</a> thirst for life, for happiness, for liberty, that<br/>
<a href="we.htm">we</a> have never quenched. And when <a href="we.htm">we</a> shall have tasted of this joy, <a href="we.htm">we</a><br/>
will set to <a href="work.htm">work</a> to demolish the last <a href="vest.htm">vest</a>iges of middle-<a href="class.htm">class</a> rule: its<br/>
morality drawn from account books, its 'debit and credit' philosophy,<br/>
its 'mine and yours' <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>itutions. 'In demolishing <a href="we.htm">we</a> shall build,' as<br/>
Proudhon said; and <a href="we.htm">we</a> shall build in the <a href="name.htm">name</a> of <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ism and Anarchy."<br/>

CHAPTER XIV<br/>
<br/>
<a href="consum.htm">CONSUM</a>PTION AND <a href="produc.htm">PRODUC</a>TION<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I<br/>
<br/>
Looking at society and its political <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization from a diffe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a><br/>
stand<a href="point.htm">point</a> than that of all the authoritarian schools--for <a href="we.htm">we</a> <a href="star.htm">star</a>t from<br/>
a <a href="free.htm">free</a> individual to reach a <a href="free.htm">free</a> society, <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ead of beginning by the<br/>
State to come down to the individual--<a href="we.htm">we</a> follow the same method in<br/>
<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic questions. <a href="we.htm">We</a> study the <a href="need.htm">need</a>s of the individuals, and the <a href="means.htm">means</a><br/>
by which they satisfy them, before discussing <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion, <a href="exch.htm">Exch</a>ange,<br/>
<a href="tax.htm">Tax</a>ation, Government, and so on. At first sight the difference may<br/>
appear trifling, but in reality it upsets all the canons of official<br/>
Political <a href="econ.htm">Econ</a>omy.<br/>
<br/>
If you <a href="open.htm">open</a> the <a href="work.htm">work</a>s of any <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omist you will find that he begins with<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">PRODUC</a>TION, _i. e._, by the analysis of the <a href="means.htm">means</a> <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ed nowadays for<br/>
the <a href="creat.htm">creat</a>ion of wealth: division of labour, the <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>y, its machinery,<br/>
the accumulation of <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>. From Adam Smith to Marx, all have proceeded<br/>
along these lines. Only in the latter parts of their books do they treat<br/>
of <a href="consum.htm">CONSUM</a>PTION, that is to say, of the <a href="means.htm">means</a> re<a href="sort.htm">sort</a>ed to in <a href="our.htm">our</a> present<br/>
Society to satisfy the <a href="need.htm">need</a>s of the individuals; and even there they<br/>
confine themselves to explaining how riches _are_ divided among those<br/>
who vie with one another for their possession.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you will say this is logical. Before satisfying <a href="need.htm">need</a>s you <a href="must.htm">must</a><br/>
<a href="creat.htm">creat</a>e the wherewithal to satisfy them. But, before <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing any<a href="thing.htm">thing</a>,<br/>
<a href="must.htm">must</a> you not feel the <a href="need.htm">need</a> of it? Was it not necessity that first drove<br/>
man to hunt, to raise cattle, to cultivate <a href="land.htm">land</a>, to <a href="make.htm">make</a> implements, and<br/>
<a href="late.htm">late</a>r on to invent machinery? Is it not the study of the <a href="need.htm">need</a>s that<br/>
should govern <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion? To say the least, it would therefore be quite<br/>
as logical to begin by considering the <a href="need.htm">need</a>s, and afterwards to discuss<br/>
how <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion is, and ought to be, <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nized, in order to satisfy these<br/>
<a href="need.htm">need</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
This is precisely what <a href="we.htm">we</a> mean to do.<br/>
<br/>
But as soon as <a href="we.htm">we</a> look at Political <a href="econ.htm">Econ</a>omy from this <a href="point.htm">point</a> of view, it<br/>
entirely <a href="chang.htm">chang</a>es its aspect. It ceases to be a simple description of<br/>
facts, and becomes a _science_, and <a href="we.htm">we</a> may define this science as: "_The<br/>
study of the <a href="need.htm">need</a>s of mankind, and the <a href="means.htm">means</a> of satisfying them with the<br/>
least possible waste of human energy_". Its true <a href="name.htm">name</a> should be,<br/>
_<a href="phys.htm">Phys</a>iology of Society_. It constitutes a parallel science to the<br/>
<a href="phys.htm">phys</a>iology of <a href="plant.htm">plant</a>s and <a href="animal.htm">animal</a>s, which is the study of the <a href="need.htm">need</a>s of<br/>
<a href="plant.htm">plant</a>s and <a href="animal.htm">animal</a>s, and of the most advantageous ways of satisfying<br/>
them. In the series of sociological sciences, the <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy of human<br/>
societies takes the place, occupied in the series of biological sciences<br/>
by the <a href="phys.htm">phys</a>iology of <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nic bodies.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> say, here are human beings, united in a society. All of them feel the<br/>
<a href="need.htm">need</a> of living in <a href="heal.htm">heal</a>thy houses. The savage's hut no longer satisfies<br/>
them; they require a more or less comfortable solid <a href="shelter.htm">shelter</a>. The<br/>
question is, then: whether, taking the present capacity of men for<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, every man can have a house of his <a href="own.htm">own</a>? and what is hindering<br/>
him from having it?<br/>
<br/>
And as soon as <a href="we.htm">we</a> ask _this_ question, <a href="we.htm">we</a> see that every family in<br/>
Europe could perfectly well have a comfortable house, such as are built<br/>
in Eng<a href="land.htm">land</a>, in Belgium, or in Pullman City, or else an equivalent set of<br/>
rooms. A certain number of days' <a href="work.htm">work</a> would suffice to build a pretty<br/>
little airy house, well fitted up and lighted by electricity.<br/>
<br/>
But nine-tenths of Europeans have never possessed a <a href="heal.htm">heal</a>thy house,<br/>
because at all <a href="time.htm">time</a>s <a href="common.htm">common</a> people have had to <a href="work.htm">work</a> day after day to<br/>
satisfy the <a href="need.htm">need</a>s of their rulers, and have never had the necessary<br/>
leisure or <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y to build, or to have built, the home of their dreams.<br/>
And they can have no houses, and will inhabit hovels as long as present<br/>
conditions remain un<a href="chang.htm">chang</a>ed.<br/>
<br/>
It is thus seen that <a href="our.htm">our</a> method is quite contrary to that of the<br/>
<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omists, who immortalize the so-called _<a href="law.htm">law</a>s_ of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, and,<br/>
reckoning up the number of houses built every year, demonstrate by<br/>
statistics, that as the number of the <a href="new.htm">new</a>-built houses _is_ too small to<br/>
meet all demands, nine-tenths of Europeans _<a href="must.htm">must</a>_ live in hovels.<br/>
<br/>
Let <a href="us.htm">us</a> <a href="pass.htm">pass</a> on to <a href="food.htm">food</a>. After having enumerated the <a href="bene.htm">bene</a>fits accruing<br/>
from the division of labour, <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omists tell <a href="us.htm">us</a> the division of labour<br/>
requires that some men should <a href="work.htm">work</a> at <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture and others at<br/>
manufacture. <a href="farm.htm">Farm</a>ers <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing so much, <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies so much, <a href="exch.htm">exch</a>ange<br/>
being carried on in such a way, they analyze the sale, the <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>, the<br/>
net gain or the <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a> <a href="valu.htm">valu</a>e, the <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>s, the <a href="tax.htm">tax</a>es, banking, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
But after having followed them so far, <a href="we.htm">we</a> are none the wiser, and if <a href="we.htm">we</a><br/>
ask them: "How is it that millions of human beings are in <a href="want.htm">want</a> of <a href="bread.htm">bread</a>,<br/>
when every family could <a href="grow.htm">grow</a> sufficient wheat to feed ten, twenty, and<br/>
even a hundred people annually?" they answer <a href="us.htm">us</a> by droning the same<br/>
anthem--division of labour, <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>s, <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a> <a href="valu.htm">valu</a>e, <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>,<br/>
etc.--arriving at the same conclusion, that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion is insufficient<br/>
to satisfy all <a href="need.htm">need</a>s; a conclusion which, if true, does not answer the<br/>
question: "Can or cannot man by his labour <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e the <a href="bread.htm">bread</a> he <a href="need.htm">need</a>s?<br/>
And if he cannot, what is it that hinders him?"<br/>
<br/>
Here are 350 million Europeans. They <a href="need.htm">need</a> so much <a href="bread.htm">bread</a>, so much meat,<br/>
<a href="win.htm">win</a>e, milk, eggs, and butter every year. They <a href="need.htm">need</a> so many houses, so<br/>
much <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>ing. This is the minimum of their <a href="need.htm">need</a>s. Can they <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e all<br/>
this? and if they can, will sufficient leisure be left them for art,<br/>
science, and amusement?--in a <a href="word.htm">word</a>, for every<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> that is not comprised<br/>
in the category of ab<a href="solu.htm">solu</a>te necessities? If the answer is in the<br/>
affirmative,--What hinders them going ahead? What <a href="must.htm">must</a> they do to remove<br/>
the obstacles? Is it <a href="time.htm">time</a> that is <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed to achieve such a result? Let<br/>
them take it! But let <a href="us.htm">us</a> not lose sight of the aim of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion--the<br/>
satisfaction of the <a href="need.htm">need</a>s of all.<br/>
<br/>
If the most imperious <a href="need.htm">need</a>s of man remain unsatisfied now,--What <a href="must.htm">must</a> <a href="we.htm">we</a><br/>
do to increase the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tivity of <a href="our.htm">our</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a>? But is there no other<br/>
cause? Might it not be that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, having lost sight of the _<a href="need.htm">need</a>s_<br/>
of man, has strayed in an ab<a href="solu.htm">solu</a>tely wrong direction, and that its<br/>
<a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization is at fault? And as <a href="we.htm">we</a> can prove that such is the case, let<br/>
<a href="us.htm">us</a> see how to re<a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nize <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion so as to really satisfy all <a href="need.htm">need</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
This seems to <a href="us.htm">us</a> the only right way of facing <a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s. The only way that<br/>
would allow of Political <a href="econ.htm">Econ</a>omy becoming a science--the Science of<br/>
Social <a href="phys.htm">Phys</a>iology.<br/>
<br/>
It is evident that so long as science treats of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, as _it is_<br/>
carried on at present by civilized nations, by Hindoo <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>es, or by<br/>
savages, it can hardly state facts otherwise than the <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omists state<br/>
them now; that is to say, as a simple _descriptive_ chapter, analogous<br/>
to the descriptive chapters of Zoology and <a href="bot.htm">Bot</a>any. But if this chapter<br/>
were written so as to throw some light on the <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy of the energy that<br/>
is necessary to satisfy human <a href="need.htm">need</a>s, the chapter would gain in<br/>
precision, as well as in descriptive <a href="valu.htm">valu</a>e. It would cl<a href="early.htm">early</a> show the<br/>
frightful waste of human energy under the present system, and it would<br/>
prove that as long as this system exists, the <a href="need.htm">need</a>s of humanity will<br/>
never be satisfied.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="point.htm">point</a> of view, <a href="we.htm">we</a> see, would be entirely <a href="chang.htm">chang</a>ed. Behind the loom<br/>
that weaves so many yards of <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>, behind the steel-p<a href="late.htm">late</a> perforator,<br/>
and behind the safe in which dividends are hoarded, <a href="we.htm">we</a> should see man,<br/>
the artisan of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, more often than not excluded from the feast<br/>
he has prepared for others. <a href="we.htm">We</a> should also understand that the<br/>
stand<a href="point.htm">point</a> being wrong, the so-called "<a href="law.htm">law</a>s" of <a href="valu.htm">valu</a>e and <a href="exch.htm">exch</a>ange are<br/>
but a very false ex<a href="plan.htm">plan</a>ation of events, as they happen nowadays; and<br/>
that <a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s will come to <a href="pass.htm">pass</a> very diffe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ly when <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion is<br/>
<a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nized in such a manner as to meet all <a href="need.htm">need</a>s of society.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
II<br/>
<br/>
There is not one single principle of Political <a href="econ.htm">Econ</a>omy that does not<br/>
<a href="chang.htm">chang</a>e its aspect if you look at it from <a href="our.htm">our</a> <a href="point.htm">point</a> of view.<br/>
<br/>
Take, for <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ance, over-<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, a <a href="word.htm">word</a> which every day re-echoes in<br/>
<a href="our.htm">our</a> ears. Is there a single <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omist, academician, or candidate for<br/>
academical honours, who has not sup<a href="port.htm">port</a>ed arguments, proving that<br/>
<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic crises are due to over-<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion--that at a given moment more<br/>
cotton, more <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>, more watches are <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed than are <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed! Have <a href="we.htm">we</a><br/>
not, all of <a href="us.htm">us</a>, thundered aga<a href="inst.htm">inst</a> the rapacity of the <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ists who<br/>
are obstinately bent on <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing more than can possibly be <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>ed!<br/>
<br/>
However, on careful examination all these reasonings prove unsound. In<br/>
fact, Is there one single commodity among those in universal <a href="use.htm">use</a> which<br/>
is <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed in greater quantity than <a href="need.htm">need</a> be. Examine one by one all<br/>
commodities sent out by countries ex<a href="port.htm">port</a>ing on a large scale, and you<br/>
will see that n<a href="early.htm">early</a> all are <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed in _insufficient_ quantities for<br/>
the inhabitants of the countries ex<a href="port.htm">port</a>ing them.<br/>
<br/>
It is not a <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a> of wheat that the Russian peasant sends to Europe.<br/>
The most plentiful har<a href="vest.htm">vest</a>s of wheat and rye in European Russia only<br/>
yield _enough_ for the population. And as a rule, the peasant deprives<br/>
himself of what he <a href="act.htm">act</a>ually <a href="need.htm">need</a>s when he <a href="sell.htm">sell</a>s his wheat or rye to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a><br/>
<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> and <a href="tax.htm">tax</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
It is not a <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a> of coal that Eng<a href="land.htm">land</a> sends to the four corners of<br/>
the globe, because only three-quarters of a ton, per head of population,<br/>
annually, remains for home domestic <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>ption, and millions of<br/>
Englishmen are deprived of fire in the <a href="win.htm">win</a>ter, or have only just enough<br/>
to boil a few vegetables. In fact, setting aside <a href="use.htm">use</a>less luxuries, there<br/>
is in Eng<a href="land.htm">land</a>, which ex<a href="port.htm">port</a>s more than any other country, one single<br/>
commodity in universal <a href="use.htm">use</a>--cottons--whose <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion is sufficiently<br/>
great to _perhaps_ exceed the <a href="need.htm">need</a>s of the <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ity. Yet when <a href="we.htm">we</a> look<br/>
upon the rags that <a href="pass.htm">pass</a> for wearing apparel worn by over a third of the<br/>
inhabitants of the United Kingdom, <a href="we.htm">we</a> are led to ask <a href="our.htm">our</a>selves whether<br/>
the cottons ex<a href="port.htm">port</a>ed would not, on the whole, suit the _real_ <a href="need.htm">need</a>s of<br/>
the population?<br/>
<br/>
As a rule it is not a <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a> that is ex<a href="port.htm">port</a>ed, though it may have been<br/>
so originally. The fable of the barefooted shoe<a href="make.htm">make</a>r is as true of<br/>
nations as it was formerly of individual artisans. <a href="we.htm">We</a> ex<a href="port.htm">port</a> the<br/>
_necessary_ commodities. And <a href="we.htm">we</a> do so, because the <a href="work.htm">work</a>men cannot <a href="buy.htm">buy</a><br/>
with their <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>s what they have <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed, _and <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> besides the <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> and<br/>
<a href="interest.htm">interest</a> to the <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ist and the banker_.<br/>
<br/>
Not only does the ever-<a href="grow.htm">grow</a>ing <a href="need.htm">need</a> of comfort remain unsatisfied, but<br/>
the strict necessities of life are often <a href="want.htm">want</a>ing. Therefore, "<a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a><br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion" does _not_ exist, at least not in the sense given to it by<br/>
the theorists of Political <a href="econ.htm">Econ</a>omy.<br/>
<br/>
Taking another <a href="point.htm">point</a>--all <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omists tell <a href="us.htm">us</a> that there is a well-proved<br/>
<a href="law.htm">law</a>: "Man <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>es more than he <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>es." After he has lived on the<br/>
proceeds of his toil, there remains a <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a>. Thus, a family of<br/>
cultivators <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>es enough to feed several families, and so forth.<br/>
<br/>
For <a href="us.htm">us</a>, this oft-repeated sentence has no sense. If it meant that each<br/>
generation leaves some<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> to <a href="future.htm">future</a> generations, it would be true;<br/>
thus, for example, a <a href="farm.htm">farm</a>er <a href="plant.htm">plant</a>s a tree that will live, maybe, for<br/>
thirty, forty, or a hundred years, and whose fruits will still be<br/>
<a href="gath.htm">gath</a>ered by the <a href="farm.htm">farm</a>er's grandchildren. Or he clears a few acres of<br/>
virgin soil, and <a href="we.htm">we</a> say that the heritage of <a href="future.htm">future</a> generations has been<br/>
increased by that much. Roads, bridges, canals, his house and his<br/>
furniture are so much wealth bequeathed to succeeding generations.<br/>
<br/>
But this is not what is meant. <a href="we.htm">We</a> are told that the cultivator <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>es<br/>
more than he _<a href="need.htm">need</a>_ <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>e. Rather should they say that, the State<br/>
having always taken from him a large <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e of his <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e for <a href="tax.htm">tax</a>es, the<br/>
priest for tithe, and the <a href="land.htm">land</a>lord for <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>, a whole <a href="class.htm">class</a> of men has<br/>
been <a href="creat.htm">creat</a>ed, who formerly <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>ed what they <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed--save what was<br/>
set aside for unforeseen accidents, or expenses incurred in<br/>
afforestation, roads, etc.--but who to-day are compelled to live very<br/>
poorly, from hand to mouth, the remainder having been taken from them by<br/>
the State, the <a href="land.htm">land</a>lord, the priest, and the <a href="usur.htm">usur</a>er.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore <a href="we.htm">we</a> prefer to say: The <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>cultural labourer, the industrial<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>er and so on _<a href="consum.htm">consum</a>e less than they <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e_,--because they are<br/>
_compelled_ to <a href="sell.htm">sell</a> most of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e of their labour and to be<br/>
satisfied with but a small <a href="port.htm">port</a>ion of it.<br/>
<br/>
Let <a href="us.htm">us</a> also ob<a href="serv.htm">serv</a>e that if the <a href="need.htm">need</a>s of the individual are taken as the<br/>
<a href="star.htm">star</a>ting-<a href="point.htm">point</a> of <a href="our.htm">our</a> political <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy, <a href="we.htm">we</a> cannot fail to reach<br/>
<a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ism, an <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization which enables <a href="us.htm">us</a> to satisfy all <a href="need.htm">need</a>s in the<br/>
most thorough and <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omical way. While if <a href="we.htm">we</a> <a href="star.htm">star</a>t from <a href="our.htm">our</a> present<br/>
method of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, and aim at gain and <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a> <a href="valu.htm">valu</a>e, without asking<br/>
whether <a href="our.htm">our</a> <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion corresponds to the satisfaction of <a href="need.htm">need</a>s, <a href="we.htm">we</a><br/>
necessarily arrive at <a href="capital.htm">Capital</a>ism, or at most at Collectivism--<a href="bot.htm">bot</a>h being<br/>
but two diffe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> forms of the present <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>s' system.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, when <a href="we.htm">we</a> consider the <a href="need.htm">need</a>s of the individual and of society,<br/>
and the <a href="means.htm">means</a> which man has re<a href="sort.htm">sort</a>ed to in order to satisfy them during<br/>
his varied phases of <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>elopment, <a href="we.htm">we</a> see at once the necessity of<br/>
systematizing <a href="our.htm">our</a> efforts, <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ead of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing haphazard as <a href="we.htm">we</a> do<br/>
nowadays. It becomes evident that the appropriation by a few of all<br/>
riches not <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>ed, and <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>mitted from one generation to another, is<br/>
not in the general <a href="interest.htm">interest</a>. And <a href="we.htm">we</a> see as a fact that owing to these<br/>
methods the <a href="need.htm">need</a>s of three-quarters of society are _not_ satisfied, so<br/>
that the present waste of human strength in <a href="use.htm">use</a>less <a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s is only the<br/>
more criminal.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> discover, moreover, that the most advantageous <a href="use.htm">use</a> of all commodities<br/>
would be, for each of them, to go, first, for satisfying those <a href="need.htm">need</a>s<br/>
which are the most pressing: that, in other <a href="word.htm">word</a>s, the so-called "<a href="valu.htm">valu</a>e<br/>
in <a href="use.htm">use</a>" of a commodity does not depend on a simple whim, as has often<br/>
been affirmed, but on the satisfaction it brings to _real_ <a href="need.htm">need</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>ism--that is to say, an <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization which would correspond to a<br/>
view of <a href="consum.htm">Consum</a>ption, <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion, and <a href="exch.htm">Exch</a>ange, taken as a<br/>
whole--therefore becomes the logical consequence of such a comprehension<br/>
of <a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s--the only one, in <a href="our.htm">our</a> opinion, that is really scientific.<br/>
<br/>
A society that will satisfy the <a href="need.htm">need</a>s of all, and which will know how to<br/>
<a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nize <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion to answer to this aim will also have to <a href="make.htm">make</a> a <a href="clean.htm">clean</a><br/>
sweep of several prejudices concerning industry, and first of all the<br/>
theory often preached by <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omists--_The Division of Labour_<br/>
theory--which <a href="we.htm">we</a> are going to discuss in the next chapter.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
CHAPTER XV<br/>
<br/>
THE DIVISION OF LABOUR<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Political <a href="econ.htm">Econ</a>omy has always confined itself to stating facts occurring<br/>
in society, and justifying them in the <a href="interest.htm">interest</a> of the dominant <a href="class.htm">class</a>.<br/>
Therefore, it pronounces itself in favour of the division of labour in<br/>
industry. Having found it <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>able to <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ists, it has set it up as<br/>
a _principle_.<br/>
<br/>
Look at the village smith, said Adam Smith, the father of <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern<br/>
Political <a href="econ.htm">Econ</a>omy. If he has never been ac<a href="cust.htm">cust</a>omed to making nails he<br/>
will only succeed by hard toil in forging two or three hundred a day,<br/>
and even then they will be bad. But if this same smith has never made<br/>
any<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> but nails, he will easily supply as many as two thousand three<br/>
hundred in the course of a day. And Smith hastened to the<br/>
conclusion--"Divide labour, specialize, go on specializing; let <a href="us.htm">us</a> have<br/>
smiths who only know how to <a href="make.htm">make</a> heads or <a href="point.htm">point</a>s of nails, and by this<br/>
<a href="means.htm">means</a> <a href="we.htm">we</a> shall <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e more. <a href="we.htm">We</a> shall <a href="grow.htm">grow</a> rich."<br/>
<br/>
That a smith condemned for life to <a href="make.htm">make</a> the heads of nails would lose<br/>
all <a href="interest.htm">interest</a> in his <a href="work.htm">work</a>, that he would be entirely at the mercy of his<br/>
<a href="employ.htm">employ</a>er with his limited handicraft, that he would be out of <a href="work.htm">work</a> four<br/>
months out of twelve, and that his <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>s would fall very low down, when<br/>
it would be easy to replace him by an app<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ice, Smith did not think of<br/>
all this when he exclaimed--"Long live the division o£ labour. This is<br/>
the real <a href="gold.htm">gold</a>-mine that will enrich the nation!" And all <a href="join.htm">join</a>ed him in<br/>
this cry.<br/>
<br/>
And <a href="late.htm">late</a>r on, when a Sismondi or a J. B. Say began to understand that<br/>
the division of labour, <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ead of enriching the whole nation, only<br/>
enriches the rich, and that the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er, who is doomed for life to making<br/>
the eighteenth part of a pin, <a href="grow.htm">grow</a>s stupid and sinks into po<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>y--what<br/>
did official <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omists propose? No<a href="thing.htm">thing</a>! They did not say to themselves<br/>
that by a lifelong grind at one and the same mechanical toil the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er<br/>
would lose his intelligence and his spirit of invention, and that, on<br/>
the contrary, a variety of occupations would result in considerably<br/>
augmenting the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tivity of a nation. But this is the very issue <a href="we.htm">we</a><br/>
have now to consider.<br/>
<br/>
If, however, learned <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omists were the only ones to preach the<br/>
permanent and often hereditary division of labour, <a href="we.htm">we</a> might allow them<br/>
to preach it as much as they pleased. But the ideas taught by doctors of<br/>
science filter into men's minds and per<a href="vert.htm">vert</a> them; and from repeatedly<br/>
hearing the division of labour, <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s, <a href="interest.htm">interest</a>, credit, etc., spoken<br/>
of as problems long since <a href="solv.htm">solv</a>ed, all middle-<a href="class.htm">class</a> people, and <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers<br/>
too, end by arguing like <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omists; they venerate the same fetishes.<br/>
<br/>
Thus <a href="we.htm">we</a> see most socialists, even those who have not feared to <a href="point.htm">point</a> out<br/>
the mistakes of <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omical science, justifying the division of labour.<br/>
Talk to them about the <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization of <a href="work.htm">work</a> during the Revolution, and<br/>
they answer that the division of labour <a href="must.htm">must</a> be maintained; that if you<br/>
<a href="shar.htm">shar</a>pened pins before the Revolution you <a href="must.htm">must</a> go on <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>pening them<br/>
after. True, you will not have to <a href="work.htm">work</a> more than five hours a day, but<br/>
you will have to <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>pen pins all your life, while others will <a href="make.htm">make</a><br/>
designs for machines that will enable you to <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>pen hundreds of<br/>
millions of pins during your life-<a href="time.htm">time</a>; and others again will be<br/>
specialists in the higher branches of literature, science, and art, etc.<br/>
You were born to <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>pen pins while <a href="past.htm">Past</a>eur was born to invent the<br/>
inoculation aga<a href="inst.htm">inst</a> anthrax, and the Revolution will leave you <a href="bot.htm">bot</a>h to<br/>
your respective <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ments. Well, it is this horrible principle, so<br/>
noxious to society, so brutalizing to the individual, <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e of so much<br/>
harm, that <a href="we.htm">we</a> propose to discuss in its divers manifestations.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> know the consequences of the division of labour full well. It is<br/>
evident that, first of all, <a href="we.htm">we</a> are divided into two <a href="class.htm">class</a>es: on the one<br/>
hand, <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ers, who <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>e very little and are exempt from thinking<br/>
because they only do <a href="phys.htm">phys</a>ical <a href="work.htm">work</a>, and who <a href="work.htm">work</a> badly because their<br/>
brains remain inactive; and on the other hand, the <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>ers, who,<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing little or hardly any<a href="thing.htm">thing</a>, have the privilege of thinking for<br/>
the others, and who think badly because the whole world of those who<br/>
toil with their hands is unknown to them. Then, <a href="we.htm">we</a> have the labourers of<br/>
the soil who know no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> of machinery, while those who <a href="work.htm">work</a> at<br/>
machinery ignore every<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> about <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture. The idea of <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern<br/>
industry is a child _tending_ a machine that he cannot and <a href="must.htm">must</a> not<br/>
understand, and a foreman who fines him if his attention flags for a<br/>
moment. The ideal of industrial <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture is to do away with the<br/>
<a href="agri.htm">agri</a>cultural labourer altogether and to set a man who does odd jobs to<br/>
tend a s<a href="team.htm">team</a>-plough or a threshing-machine. The division of labour <a href="means.htm">means</a><br/>
labelling and stamping men for life--some to splice ropes in <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies,<br/>
some to be foremen in a business, others to shove huge coal-baskets in a<br/>
particular part of a mine; but none of them to have any idea of<br/>
machinery as a whole, nor of business, nor of mines. And thereby they<br/>
destroy the love of <a href="work.htm">work</a> and the capacity for invention that, at the<br/>
beginning of <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern industry, <a href="creat.htm">creat</a>ed the machinery on which <a href="we.htm">we</a> pride<br/>
<a href="our.htm">our</a>selves so much.<br/>
<br/>
What they have done for individuals, they also <a href="want.htm">want</a>ed to do for nations.<br/>
Humanity was to be divided into national <a href="work.htm">work</a>shops, having each its<br/>
speciality. Russia, <a href="we.htm">we</a> were taught, was destined by nature to <a href="grow.htm">grow</a> corn;<br/>
Eng<a href="land.htm">land</a> to spin cotton; Belgium to weave <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>; while Switzer<a href="land.htm">land</a> was to<br/>
train nurses and governesses. Moreover, each separate city was to<br/>
establish a specialty. Lyons was to weave silk, Auvergne to <a href="make.htm">make</a> lace,<br/>
and Paris fancy articles. In this way, <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omists said, an immense field<br/>
was <a href="open.htm">open</a>ed for <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>ption, and in this way an era of<br/>
limitless wealth for mankind was at hand.<br/>
<br/>
However, these great hopes vanished as fast as technical knowledge<br/>
spread abroad. As long as Eng<a href="land.htm">land</a> stood alone as a weaver of cotton and<br/>
as a <a href="meta.htm">meta</a>l-<a href="work.htm">work</a>er on a large scale; as long as only Paris made artistic<br/>
fancy articles, etc., all went well, <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omists could preach the<br/>
so-called division of labour without being refuted.<br/>
<br/>
But a <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="cur.htm">cur</a><a href="rent.htm">rent</a> of thought induced bye and bye all civilized nations<br/>
to manufacture for themselves. They found it advantageous to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e<br/>
what they formerly received from other countries, or from their<br/>
colonies, which in their turn aimed at emancipating themselves from the<br/>
mother-country. Scientific discoveries universalized the methods of<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, and henceforth it was <a href="use.htm">use</a>less to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> an exorbitant <a href="price.htm">price</a><br/>
abroad for what could easily be <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed at home. And now <a href="we.htm">we</a> see already<br/>
that this industrial revolution strikes a crushing blow at the theory of<br/>
the division of labour which for a long <a href="time.htm">time</a> was supposed to be so<br/>
sound.<br/>
<br/>

CHAPTER XVI<br/>
<br/>
THE DECENTRALIZATION OF INDUSTRY<small>[10]</small><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I<br/>
<br/>
After the Napoleonic wars Britain had n<a href="early.htm">early</a> succeeded in ruining the<br/>
main industries which had sprung up in France at the end of the<br/>
preceding century. She also became mistress of the seas and had no<br/>
rivals of im<a href="port.htm">port</a>ance. She took in the situation, and knew how to turn<br/>
its privileges and advantages to account. She established an industrial<br/>
monopoly, and, imposing upon her neighbours her <a href="price.htm">price</a>s for the <a href="good.htm">good</a>s she<br/>
alone could manufacture, accumu<a href="late.htm">late</a>d riches upon riches.<br/>
<br/>
But as the middle-<a href="class.htm">class</a> Revolution of the eighteenth century had<br/>
abolished serfdom and <a href="creat.htm">creat</a>ed a proletariat in France, French industry,<br/>
hampered for a <a href="time.htm">time</a> in its flight, soared again, and from the s<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>d<br/>
half of the nineteenth century France ceased to be a tributary of<br/>
Eng<a href="land.htm">land</a> for manufactured <a href="good.htm">good</a>s. To-day she too has <a href="grow.htm">grow</a>n into a nation<br/>
with an ex<a href="port.htm">port</a> <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e. She <a href="sell.htm">sell</a>s far more than sixty million pounds'<br/>
<a href="worth.htm">worth</a> of manufactured <a href="good.htm">good</a>s, and two-thirds of these <a href="good.htm">good</a>s are fabrics.<br/>
The number of Frenchmen <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing for ex<a href="port.htm">port</a> or living by their foreign<br/>
<a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e, is estimated at three millions.<br/>
<br/>
France is therefore no longer Eng<a href="land.htm">land</a>'s tributary. In her turn she has<br/>
striven to monopolize certain branches of foreign industry, such as<br/>
silks and ready-made <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>es, and has reaped immense <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s therefrom;<br/>
but she is on the <a href="point.htm">point</a> of losing this monopoly for ever, just as<br/>
Eng<a href="land.htm">land</a> is on the <a href="point.htm">point</a> of losing the monopoly of cotton <a href="good.htm">good</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
Travelling eastwards, industry has reached Germany. Fifty years ago<br/>
Germany was a tributary of Eng<a href="land.htm">land</a> and France for most manufactured<br/>
commodities in the higher branches of industry. It is no longer so. In<br/>
the course of the last fifty years, and especially since the<br/>
Franco-German war, Germany has completely re<a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nized her industry. The<br/>
<a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies are stocked with the best machinery; the <a href="late.htm">late</a>st <a href="creat.htm">creat</a>ions<br/>
of industrial art in cotton <a href="good.htm">good</a>s from Manchester, or in silks from<br/>
Lyons, etc., are now realized in <a href="new.htm">new</a> German <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies. It took two or<br/>
three generations of <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers, at Lyons and Manchester, to construct the<br/>
<a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern machinery; but Germany adopted it in its perfected state.<br/>
Technical schools, adapted to the <a href="need.htm">need</a>s of industry, supply the<br/>
<a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies with an army of intelligent <a href="work.htm">work</a>men--practical engineers, who<br/>
can <a href="work.htm">work</a> with <a href="bot.htm">bot</a>h hand and brain. German industry <a href="star.htm">star</a>ts at the <a href="point.htm">point</a><br/>
which was only reached by Manchester and Lyons after fifty years of<br/>
groping in the dark, of exertion and experiments.<br/>
<br/>
It follows that since Germany manufactures so well at home, she<br/>
diminishes her im<a href="port.htm">port</a>s from France and Eng<a href="land.htm">land</a> year by year. She has not<br/>
only become their rival in manufactured <a href="good.htm">good</a>s in Asia and in Africa, but<br/>
also in London and in Paris. Shortsighted people in France may cry out<br/>
aga<a href="inst.htm">inst</a> the Frankfort Treaty; English manufacturers may explain German<br/>
competition by little differences in railway tariffs; they may linger on<br/>
the petty side of questions, and neglect great historical facts. But it<br/>
is none the less certain that the main industries, formerly in the hands<br/>
of Eng<a href="land.htm">land</a> and France, have progressed eastward, and in Germany they<br/>
have found a country, young, full of energy, possessing an intelligent<br/>
middle <a href="class.htm">class</a>, and eager in its turn to enrich itself by foreign <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
While Germany has <a href="free.htm">free</a>d herself from subjection to France and Eng<a href="land.htm">land</a>,<br/>
has manufactured her <a href="own.htm">own</a> cotton-<a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>, and constructed her <a href="own.htm">own</a><br/>
machines--in fact, manufactured all commodities--the main industries<br/>
have also taken root in Russia, where the <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>elopment of manufacture is<br/>
the more <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ructive as it sprang up but yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
At the <a href="time.htm">time</a> of the abolition of serfdom in 1861, Russia had hardly any<br/>
<a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies. Every<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed in the way of machines, rails,<br/>
railway-engines, fine dress <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ials, came from the West. Twenty years<br/>
<a href="late.htm">late</a>r she possessed already 85,000 <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies, and the <a href="valu.htm">valu</a>e of the <a href="good.htm">good</a>s<br/>
manufactured in Russia had increased fourfold.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="old.htm">old</a> machinery was superseded, and now n<a href="early.htm">early</a> all the steel in <a href="use.htm">use</a> in<br/>
Russia, three-quarters of the iron, two-thirds of the coal, all<br/>
railway-engines, railway-carriages, rails, n<a href="early.htm">early</a> all s<a href="team.htm">team</a>ers, are made<br/>
in Russia.<br/>
<br/>
Russia, destined--so wrote <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omists--to remain an <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>cultural<br/>
territory, has rapidly <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>eloped into a manufacturing country. She<br/>
orders hardly any<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> from Eng<a href="land.htm">land</a>, and very little from Germany.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="econ.htm">Econ</a>omists <a href="hold.htm">hold</a> the <a href="cust.htm">cust</a>oms responsible for these facts, and yet cottons<br/>
manufactured in Russia are <a href="sold.htm">sold</a> at the same <a href="price.htm">price</a> as in London. <a href="capital.htm">Capital</a><br/>
taking no cognizance of father-<a href="land.htm">land</a>s, German and English <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ists,<br/>
accompanied by engineers and foremen of their <a href="own.htm">own</a> nationalities, have<br/>
introduced in Russia and in Po<a href="land.htm">land</a> manu<a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies whose <a href="good.htm">good</a>s compete in<br/>
ex<a href="cell.htm">cell</a>ence with the best from Eng<a href="land.htm">land</a>. If <a href="cust.htm">cust</a>oms were abolished<br/>
to-morrow, manufacture would only gain by it. Not long ago the British<br/>
manufacturers delivered another hard blow to the im<a href="port.htm">port</a> of <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a> and<br/>
woo<a href="lens.htm">lens</a> from the West. They set up in southern and middle Russia immense<br/>
wool <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies, stocked with the most perfect machinery from Bradford,<br/>
and already now Russia im<a href="port.htm">port</a>s only the highest <a href="sort.htm">sort</a>s of <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a> and<br/>
woolen fabrics from Eng<a href="land.htm">land</a>, France and Austria. The remainder is<br/>
fabricated at home, <a href="bot.htm">bot</a>h in <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies and as domestic industries.<br/>
<br/>
The main industries not only move eastward, they are spreading also to<br/>
the southern peninsulas. The Turin Exhibition of 1884 already<br/>
demonstrated the progress made in Italian manufactured <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e; and, let<br/>
<a href="us.htm">us</a> not <a href="make.htm">make</a> any mistake about it, the mutual hatred of the French and<br/>
Italian middle <a href="class.htm">class</a>es has no other origin than their industrial<br/>
rivalry. Spain is also becoming an industrial country; while in the<br/>
East, Bohemia has suddenly sprung into im<a href="port.htm">port</a>ance as a <a href="new.htm">new</a> centre of<br/>
manufactures, provided with perfected machinery and applying the best<br/>
scientific methods.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> might also mention Hungary's rapid progress in the main industries,<br/>
but let <a href="us.htm">us</a> rather take Brazil as an example. <a href="econ.htm">Econ</a>omists sentenced Brazil<br/>
to cultivate cotton forever, to ex<a href="port.htm">port</a> it in its raw state, and to<br/>
receive cotton-<a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a> from Europe in <a href="exch.htm">exch</a>ange. In fact, forty years ago<br/>
Brazil had only nine wretched little cotton <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies with 385 spindles.<br/>
To-day there are 160 cotton-mills, possessing 1,500,000 spindles and<br/>
50,000 looms, which throw 500 million yards of <a href="text.htm">text</a>iles on the market<br/>
annually.<br/>
<br/>
Even Mexico is now very successful in manufacturing cotton-<a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>,<br/>
<a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ead of im<a href="port.htm">port</a>ing it from Europe. As to the United States they have<br/>
quite <a href="free.htm">free</a>d themselves from European tutelage, and have triumphantly<br/>
<a href="dev.htm">dev</a>eloped their manufacturing powers to an enormous extent.<br/>
<br/>
But it was India which gave the most striking proof aga<a href="inst.htm">inst</a> the<br/>
specialization of national industry.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> all know the theory: the great European nations <a href="need.htm">need</a> colonies, for<br/>
colonies send raw <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ial--cotton fibre, un<a href="wash.htm">wash</a>ed wool, spices, etc.,<br/>
to the mother-<a href="land.htm">land</a>. And the mother-<a href="land.htm">land</a>, under pretense of sending them<br/>
manufactured wares, gets rid of her damaged stuffs, her machine<br/>
scrap-iron and every<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> which she no longer has any <a href="use.htm">use</a> for. It <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s<br/>
her little or no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a>, and none the less the articles are <a href="sold.htm">sold</a> at<br/>
exorbitant <a href="price.htm">price</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
Such was the theory--such was the practice for a long <a href="time.htm">time</a>. In London<br/>
and Manchester fortunes were made, while India was being ruined. In the<br/>
India Museum in London unheard of riches, collected in Calcutta and<br/>
Bombay by English merchants, are to be seen.<br/>
<br/>
But other English merchants and <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ists conceived the very simple<br/>
idea that it would be more expedient to exploit the natives of India by<br/>
making cotton-<a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a> in India itself, than to im<a href="port.htm">port</a> from twenty to<br/>
twenty-four million pounds' <a href="worth.htm">worth</a> of <a href="good.htm">good</a>s annually.<br/>
<br/>
At first a series of experiments ended in failure. Indian<br/>
weavers--artists and experts in their <a href="own.htm">own</a> craft--could not inure<br/>
themselves to <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>y life; the machinery sent from Liverpool was bad;<br/>
the climate had to be taken into account; and merchants had to adapt<br/>
themselves to <a href="new.htm">new</a> conditions, now fully mastered, before British India<br/>
could become the menacing rival of the Mother-<a href="land.htm">land</a> she is to-day.<br/>
<br/>
She now possesses more than 200 cotton-mills which <a href="employ.htm">employ</a> about 230,000<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>men, and contain more than 6,000,000 spindles and 80,000 looms, and<br/>
40 jute-mills, with 400,000 spindles. She ex<a href="port.htm">port</a>s annually to China, to<br/>
the Dutch Indies, and to Africa, n<a href="early.htm">early</a> eight million pounds' <a href="worth.htm">worth</a> of<br/>
the same white cotton-<a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>, said to be Eng<a href="land.htm">land</a>'s specialty. And while<br/>
English <a href="work.htm">work</a>men are often un<a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ed and in great <a href="want.htm">want</a>, Indian women<br/>
weave cotton by machinery, for the Far East at <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>s of six-pence a day.<br/>
In short, the intelligent manufacturers are fully aware that the day is<br/>
not far off when they will not know what to do with the "<a href="factor.htm">factor</a>y hands"<br/>
who formerly wove cotton-<a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a> for ex<a href="port.htm">port</a> from Eng<a href="land.htm">land</a>. Besides which it<br/>
is becoming more and more evident that India will no im<a href="port.htm">port</a> a single ton<br/>
of iron from Eng<a href="land.htm">land</a>. The initial difficulties in using the coal and the<br/>
iron-ore obtained in India have been overcome; and foundries, rivalling<br/>
those in Eng<a href="land.htm">land</a>, have been built on the shores of the Indian Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Colonies competing with the mother-<a href="land.htm">land</a> in its <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion of<br/>
manufactured <a href="good.htm">good</a>s, such is the <a href="factor.htm">factor</a> which will regu<a href="late.htm">late</a> <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy in<br/>
the twentieth century.<br/>
<br/>
And why should India not manufacture? What should be the hindrance?<br/>
<a href="capital.htm">Capital</a>?--But <a href="capital.htm">capital</a> goes wherever there are men, poor enough to be<br/>
exploited. Knowledge? But knowledge recognizes no national <a href="barrier.htm">barrier</a>s.<br/>
Technical <a href="skill.htm">skill</a> of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er?--No. Are, then, Hindoo <a href="work.htm">work</a>men inferior<br/>
to the hundreds of thousands of boys and girls, not eighteen years <a href="old.htm">old</a>,<br/>
at present <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing in the English <a href="text.htm">text</a>ile <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
II<br/>
<br/>
After having glanced at national industries it would be very <a href="interest.htm">interest</a>ing<br/>
to turn to some special branches.<br/>
<br/>
Let <a href="us.htm">us</a> take silk, for example, an eminently French <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e in the first<br/>
half of the nineteenth century. <a href="we.htm">We</a> all know how Lyons became the<br/>
emporium of the silk <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e. At first raw silk was <a href="gath.htm">gath</a>ered in southern<br/>
France, till little by little they ordered it from Italy, from Spain,<br/>
from Austria, from the Caucasus, and from Japan, for the manufacture of<br/>
their silk fabrics. In 1875, out of five million kilos of raw silk<br/>
con<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>ed into stuffs in the vicinity of Lyons, there were only four<br/>
hundred thousand kilos of French silk. But if Lyons manufactured<br/>
im<a href="port.htm">port</a>ed silk, why should not Switzer<a href="land.htm">land</a>, Germany, Russia, do as much?<br/>
Consequently, silk-weaving began to <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>elop in the villages round<br/>
Zurich. Bâle became a great centre of the silk <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e. The Caucasian<br/>
Administration engaged women from Marseilles and <a href="work.htm">work</a>men from Lyons to<br/>
teach Georgians the perfected rearing of silk-worms, and the art of<br/>
con<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>ing silk into fabrics to the Caucasian peasants. Austria<br/>
followed. Then Germany, with the help of Lyons <a href="work.htm">work</a>men, built great silk<br/>
<a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies. The United States did likewise at Paterson.<br/>
<br/>
And to-day the silk <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e is no longer a French monopoly. Silks are made<br/>
in Germany, in Austria, in the United States, and in Eng<a href="land.htm">land</a>, and it is<br/>
now reckoned that one-third of the silk stuffs <a href="use.htm">use</a>d in France are<br/>
im<a href="port.htm">port</a>ed. In <a href="win.htm">win</a>ter, Caucasian peasants weave silk handkerchiefs at a<br/>
<a href="wage.htm">wage</a> that would mean <a href="star.htm">star</a>vation to the silk-weavers of Lyons. Italy and<br/>
Germany send silks to France; and Lyons, which in 1870-4 ex<a href="port.htm">port</a>ed 460<br/>
million francs' <a href="worth.htm">worth</a> of silk fabrics, ex<a href="port.htm">port</a>s now only one-half of that<br/>
amount. In fact, the <a href="time.htm">time</a> is not far off when Lyons will only send<br/>
higher <a href="class.htm">class</a> <a href="good.htm">good</a>s and a few novelties as patterns to Germany, Russia<br/>
and Japan.<br/>
<br/>
And so it is in all industries. Belgium has no longer the <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a><br/>
monopoly; <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a> is made in Germany, in Russia, in Austria, in the United<br/>
States. Switzer<a href="land.htm">land</a> and the French Jura have no longer a c<a href="lock.htm">lock</a><a href="work.htm">work</a><br/>
monopoly; watches are made everywhere. Scot<a href="land.htm">land</a> no longer refines sugar<br/>
for Russia: refined Russian sugar is im<a href="port.htm">port</a>ed into Eng<a href="land.htm">land</a>. Italy,<br/>
although neither possessing coal nor iron, <a href="make.htm">make</a>s her <a href="own.htm">own</a> iron-clads and<br/>
engines for her s<a href="team.htm">team</a>ers. Chemical industry is no longer an English<br/>
monopoly; sulphuric acid and soda are made even in the Urals.<br/>
S<a href="team.htm">team</a>-engines, made at <a href="win.htm">Win</a>terthur, have acquired everywhere a wide<br/>
reputation, and at the present moment, Switzer<a href="land.htm">land</a>, which has neither<br/>
coal nor iron, and no sea-<a href="port.htm">port</a>s to im<a href="port.htm">port</a> them--no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> but ex<a href="cell.htm">cell</a>ent<br/>
technical schools--<a href="make.htm">make</a>s machinery better and cheaper than Eng<a href="land.htm">land</a>. So<br/>
ends the theory of <a href="exch.htm">Exch</a>ange.<br/>
<br/>
The tendency of <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e, as for all else, is toward decentralization.<br/>
<br/>
Every nation finds it advantageous to combine <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture with the<br/>
greatest possible variety of <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies. The specialization, of which<br/>
<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omists spoke so highly, certainly has enriched a number of<br/>
<a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ists, but is now no longer of any <a href="use.htm">use</a>. On the contrary, it is to<br/>
the advantage of every region, every nation, to <a href="grow.htm">grow</a> their <a href="own.htm">own</a> wheat,<br/>
their <a href="own.htm">own</a> vegetables, and to manufacture at home most of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e<br/>
they <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>e. This diversity is the surest pledge of the complete<br/>
<a href="dev.htm">dev</a>elopment of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion by mutual co-operation, and the moving cause<br/>
of progress, while specialization is now a hindrance to progress.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="agri.htm">Agri</a>culture can only prosper in proximity to <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies. And no sooner<br/>
does a single <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>y appear than an infinite variety of other <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies<br/>
_<a href="must.htm">must</a>_ spring up around, so that, mutually sup<a href="port.htm">port</a>ing and stimulating<br/>
one another by their inventions, they increase their <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tivity.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
III<br/>
<br/>
It is foolish indeed to ex<a href="port.htm">port</a> wheat and to im<a href="port.htm">port</a> flour, to ex<a href="port.htm">port</a> wool<br/>
and im<a href="port.htm">port</a> <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>, to ex<a href="port.htm">port</a> iron and im<a href="port.htm">port</a> machinery; not only because<br/>
<a href="trans.htm">trans</a><a href="port.htm">port</a>ation is a waste of <a href="time.htm">time</a> and <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y, but, above all, because a<br/>
country with no <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>eloped industry inevitably remains behind the <a href="time.htm">time</a>s<br/>
in <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture; because a country with no large <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies to bring steel<br/>
to a finished condition is doomed to be backward in all other<br/>
industries; and lastly, because the industrial and technical capacities<br/>
of the nation remain undeveloped, if they are not exercised in a variety<br/>
of industries.<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays every<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> <a href="hold.htm">hold</a>s together in the world of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
Cultivation of the soil is no longer possible without machinery, without<br/>
great irrigation <a href="work.htm">work</a>s, without railways, without manure <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies. And<br/>
to adapt this machinery, these railways, these irrigation engines, etc.,<br/>
to local conditions, a certain spirit of invention, and a certain amount<br/>
of technical <a href="skill.htm">skill</a> <a href="must.htm">must</a> be <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>eloped, while they necessarily lie dormant<br/>
so long as spades and plough<a href="shar.htm">shar</a>es are the only implements of<br/>
cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
If fields are to be <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ly cultivated, if they are to yield the<br/>
<a href="abund.htm">abund</a>ant har<a href="vest.htm">vest</a>s that man has the right to expect, it is essential that<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>shops, foundries, and <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>elop within the reach of the<br/>
fields. A variety of occupations, and a variety of <a href="skill.htm">skill</a> arising<br/>
therefrom, <a href="bot.htm">bot</a>h <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing together for a <a href="common.htm">common</a> aim--these are the true<br/>
forces of progress.<br/>
<br/>
And now let <a href="us.htm">us</a> imagine the inhabitants of a city or a territory--whether<br/>
vast or small--stepping for the first <a href="time.htm">time</a> on to the path of the Social<br/>
Revolution.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> are some<a href="time.htm">time</a>s told that "no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> will have <a href="chang.htm">chang</a>ed": that the mines,<br/>
the <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies, etc., will be expropriated, and proclaimed national or<br/>
<a href="commun.htm">commun</a>al <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty, that every man will go back to his usual <a href="work.htm">work</a>, and<br/>
that the Revolution will then be accomplished.<br/>
<br/>
But this is a mere dream: the Social Revolution cannot take place so<br/>
simply.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> have already mentioned that should the Revolution break out to-morrow<br/>
in Paris, Lyons, or any other city--should the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers lay hands on<br/>
<a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies, houses, and banks, present <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion would be completely<br/>
revolutionized by this simple fact.<br/>
<br/>
International <a href="commer.htm">commer</a>ce will come to a standstill; so also will the<br/>
im<a href="port.htm">port</a>ation of foreign <a href="bread.htm">bread</a>-stuffs; the circulation of commodities and<br/>
of provisions will be paralyzed. And then, the city or territory in<br/>
revolt will be compelled to provide for itself, and to re<a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nize its<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, so as to satisfy its <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="need.htm">need</a>s. If it fails to do so, it is<br/>
death. If it succeeds, it will revolutionize the <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic life of the<br/>
country.<br/>
<br/>
The quantity of im<a href="port.htm">port</a>ed provisions having decreased, <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>ption having<br/>
increased, one million Parisians <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing for ex<a href="port.htm">port</a>ation purposes having<br/>
been thrown out of <a href="work.htm">work</a>, a great number of <a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s im<a href="port.htm">port</a>ed to-day from<br/>
distant or neighbouring countries not reaching their destination,<br/>
fancy-<a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e being temporarily at a standstill,--What will the<br/>
inhabitants have to <a href="eat.htm">eat</a> six months after the Revolution?<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> think that when the stores containing <a href="food.htm">food</a>-stuffs are empty, the<br/>
masses will seek to obtain their <a href="food.htm">food</a> from the <a href="land.htm">land</a>. They will see the<br/>
necessity of cultivating the soil, of combining <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>cultural <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion<br/>
with industrial <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion in the suburbs of Paris itself and its<br/>
environs. They will have to abandon the merely or<a href="name.htm">name</a>ntal <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>es and<br/>
consider their most urgent <a href="need.htm">need</a>--<a href="bread.htm">bread</a>.<br/>
<br/>
A great number of the inhabitants of the cities will have to become<br/>
<a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culturists. Not in the same manner as the present peasants who wear<br/>
themselves out, ploughing for a <a href="wage.htm">wage</a> that barely provides them with<br/>
sufficient <a href="food.htm">food</a> for the year, but by following the principles of the<br/>
intensive <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture, of the market gardeners, applied on a large scale<br/>
by <a href="means.htm">means</a> of the best machinery that man has invented or can invent. They<br/>
will till the <a href="land.htm">land</a>--not, however, like the country beast of burden: a<br/>
Paris jeweller would <a href="object.htm">object</a> to that. They will <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nize cultivation on<br/>
better principles; and not in the <a href="future.htm">future</a>, but at once, during the<br/>
revolutionary struggles, from fear of being worsted by the enemy.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="agri.htm">Agri</a>culture will have to be carried out on intelligent lines, by men and<br/>
women availing themselves of the experience of the present <a href="time.htm">time</a>,<br/>
<a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nizing themselves in joyous gangs for pleasant <a href="work.htm">work</a>, like those who,<br/>
a hundred years ago, <a href="work.htm">work</a>ed in the Champ de Mars for the Feast of the<br/>
Federation--a <a href="work.htm">work</a> of delight, when not carried to excess, when<br/>
scientifically <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nized, when man invents and improves his tools and is<br/>
conscious of being a <a href="use.htm">use</a>ful member of the <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ity.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, they will not only cultivate wheat and oats--they will also<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e those <a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s which they formerly <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to order from foreign<br/>
parts. And let <a href="us.htm">us</a> not forget that for the inhabitants of a revolted<br/>
territory, "foreign parts" may include all districts that have not<br/>
<a href="join.htm">join</a>ed in the revolutionary movement. During the Revolutions of 1793 and<br/>
1871 Paris was made to feel that "foreign parts" meant even the country<br/>
district at her very gates. The speculator in grains at Troyes <a href="star.htm">star</a>ved<br/>
in 1793 and 1794 the sansculottes of Paris as badly, and even worse,<br/>
than the German armies brought on to French soil by the Versailles<br/>
conspirators. The revolted city will be compelled to do without these<br/>
"foreigners," and why not? France invented beet-root sugar when<br/>
sugar-cane ran short during the continental b<a href="lock.htm">lock</a>ade. Parisians<br/>
discovered saltpetre in their <a href="cell.htm">cell</a>ars when they no longer received any<br/>
from abroad. Shall <a href="we.htm">we</a> be inferior to <a href="our.htm">our</a> grandfathers, who hardly lisped<br/>
the first <a href="word.htm">word</a>s of science?<br/>
<br/>
A revolution is more than a mere <a href="chang.htm">chang</a>e of the prevailing political<br/>
system. It implies the awakening of human intelligence, the increasing<br/>
of the inventive spirit tenfold, a hundredfold; it is the dawn of a <a href="new.htm">new</a><br/>
science--the science of men like Laplace, Lamarck, Lavoisier. It is a<br/>
revolution in the minds of men, as deep, and deeper still, than in their<br/>
<a href="inst.htm">inst</a>itutions.<br/>
<br/>
And there are still <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omists, who tell <a href="us.htm">us</a> that once the "revolution is<br/>
made," everyone will <a href="return.htm">return</a> to his <a href="work.htm">work</a>shop, as if <a href="pass.htm">pass</a>ing through a<br/>
revolution were going home after a walk in the Epping forest!<br/>
<br/>
To begin with, the sole fact of having laid hands on middle-<a href="class.htm">class</a><br/>
<a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty will imply the necessity of completely re<a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nizing the whole<br/>
of <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic life in the <a href="work.htm">work</a>shops, the dockyards, the <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies.<br/>
<br/>
And the revolution surely will not fail to <a href="act.htm">act</a> in this direction. Should<br/>
Paris, during the social revolution, be cut off from the world for a<br/>
year or two by the sup<a href="port.htm">port</a>ers of middle-<a href="class.htm">class</a> rule, its millions of<br/>
intellects, not yet depressed by <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>y life--that City of little<br/>
<a href="trad.htm">trad</a>es which stimu<a href="late.htm">late</a> the spirit of invention--will show the world what<br/>
man's brain can accomplish without asking for help from without, but the<br/>
motor force of the <a href="sun.htm">sun</a> that gives light, the power of the <a href="win.htm">win</a>d that<br/>
sweeps away impurities, and the silent life-forces at <a href="work.htm">work</a> in the earth<br/>
<a href="we.htm">we</a> tread on.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> shall see then what a variety of <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>es, mutually cooperating on a<br/>
spot of the globe and animated by a revolution, can do to feed, <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>e,<br/>
house, and supply with all manner of luxuries millions of intelligent<br/>
men.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> <a href="need.htm">need</a> write no fiction to prove this. What <a href="we.htm">we</a> are sure of, what has<br/>
already been experimented upon, and recognized as practical, would<br/>
suffice to <a href="carry.htm">carry</a> it into effect, if the attempt were fertilized,<br/>
vivified by the daring inspiration of the Revolution and the spontaneous<br/>
impulse of the masses.<br/>

CHAPTER XVII<br/>
<br/>
<a href="agri.htm">AGRI</a>CULTURE<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I<br/>
<br/>
Political <a href="econ.htm">Econ</a>omy has often been reproached with drawing all its<br/>
deductions from the decidedly false principle, that the only incentive<br/>
capable of forcing a man to augment his power of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion is <a href="person.htm">person</a>al<br/>
<a href="interest.htm">interest</a> in its narrowest sense.<br/>
<br/>
The reproach is perfectly true; so true that epochs of great industrial<br/>
discoveries and true progress in industry are precisely those in which<br/>
the happiness of all was inspiring men, and in which <a href="person.htm">person</a>al enrichment<br/>
was least thought of. The great in<a href="vest.htm">vest</a>igators in science and the great<br/>
inventors aimed, above all, at giving greater <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom of mankind. And if<br/>
Watt, Stephenson, Jacquard, etc., could have only foreseen what a state<br/>
of misery their sleepless nights would bring to the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers, they<br/>
certainly would have burned their designs and broken their <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>els.<br/>
<br/>
Another principle that pervades Political <a href="econ.htm">Econ</a>omy is just as false. It<br/>
is the tacit admission, <a href="common.htm">common</a> to all <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omists, that if there is often<br/>
over-<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion in certain branches, a society will ne<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>heless never<br/>
have sufficient <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts to satisfy the <a href="want.htm">want</a>s of all, and that<br/>
consequently the day will never come when nobody will be forced to <a href="sell.htm">sell</a><br/>
his labour in <a href="exch.htm">exch</a>ange for <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>s. This tacit admission is found at the<br/>
basis of all theories and all the so-called "<a href="law.htm">law</a>s" taught by <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omists.<br/>
<br/>
And yet it is certain that the day when any civilized association of<br/>
individuals would ask itself, _what are the <a href="need.htm">need</a>s of all, and the <a href="means.htm">means</a><br/>
of satisfying them_, it would see that, in industry, as in <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture,<br/>
it already possesses sufficient to provide <a href="abund.htm">abund</a>antly for all <a href="need.htm">need</a>s, on<br/>
condition that it knows how to apply these <a href="means.htm">means</a> to satisfy real <a href="need.htm">need</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
That this is true as regards industry no one can contest. Indeed, it<br/>
suffices to study the processes already in <a href="use.htm">use</a> to extract coals and ore,<br/>
to obtain steel and <a href="work.htm">work</a> it, to manufacture on a great scale what is<br/>
<a href="use.htm">use</a>d for <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>ing, etc., in order to perceive that <a href="we.htm">we</a> could already<br/>
increase <a href="our.htm">our</a> <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion fourfold or more, and yet <a href="use.htm">use</a> for that _less_<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a> than <a href="we.htm">we</a> are using now.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> go further. <a href="we.htm">We</a> assert that <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture is in the same position: those<br/>
who cultivate the soil, like the manufacturers, already could increase<br/>
their <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, not only fourfold but tenfold, and they can put it<br/>
into practice as soon as they feel the <a href="need.htm">need</a> of it,--as soon as a<br/>
socialist <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization of <a href="work.htm">work</a> will be established <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ead of the<br/>
present <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>istic one.<br/>
<br/>
Each <a href="time.htm">time</a> <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture is spoken of, men imagine a peasant bending over<br/>
the plough, throwing badly as<a href="sort.htm">sort</a>ed corn haphazard into the ground and<br/>
waiting anxiously for what the <a href="good.htm">good</a> or bad season will bring forth; they<br/>
think of a family <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing from morn to night and reaping as reward a<br/>
rude bed, dry <a href="bread.htm">bread</a>, and coarse beverage. In a <a href="word.htm">word</a>, they picture "the<br/>
savages" of La Bruyère.<br/>
<br/>
And for these men, ground down to such a misery, the utmost relief that<br/>
society proposes, is to reduce their <a href="tax.htm">tax</a>es or their <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>. But even most<br/>
social reformers do not care to imagine a cultivator standing erect,<br/>
taking leisure, and <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing by a few hours' <a href="work.htm">work</a> per day sufficient<br/>
<a href="food.htm">food</a> to nourish, not only his <a href="own.htm">own</a> family, but a hundred men more at the<br/>
least. In their most glowing dreams of the <a href="future.htm">future</a> Socialists do not go<br/>
beyond American extensive culture, which, after all, is but the infancy<br/>
of <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>cultural art.<br/>
<br/>
But the thinking <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culturist has broader ideas to-day--his conceptions<br/>
are on a far grander scale. He only asks for a fraction of an acre in<br/>
order to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e sufficient vegetables for a family; and to feed<br/>
twenty-five horned beasts he <a href="need.htm">need</a>s no more space than he formerly<br/>
required to feed one; his aim is to <a href="make.htm">make</a> his <a href="own.htm">own</a> soil, to defy seasons<br/>
and climate, to warm <a href="bot.htm">bot</a>h air and earth around the young <a href="plant.htm">plant</a>; to<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e, in a <a href="word.htm">word</a>, on one acre what he <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to <a href="gath.htm">gath</a>er from fifty acres,<br/>
and that without any excessive fatigue--by greatly reducing, on the<br/>
contrary, the total of former labour. He knows that <a href="we.htm">we</a> will be able to<br/>
feed everybody by giving to the culture of the fields no more <a href="time.htm">time</a> than<br/>
what each can give with pleasure and joy.<br/>
<br/>
This is the present tendency of <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture.<br/>
<br/>
While scientific men, led by Liebig, the <a href="creat.htm">creat</a>or of the chemical theory<br/>
of <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture, often got on the wrong tack in their love of mere<br/>
theories, unlettered <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culturists <a href="open.htm">open</a>ed up <a href="new.htm">new</a> roads to prosperity.<br/>
Market-gardeners of Paris, Troyes, Rouen, Scotch and English gardeners,<br/>
Flemish and Lombardian <a href="farm.htm">farm</a>ers, peasants of Jersey, Guernsey, and<br/>
<a href="farm.htm">farm</a>ers on the Scilly Isles have <a href="open.htm">open</a>ed up such large horizons that the<br/>
mind hesitates to grasp them. While up till <a href="late.htm">late</a>ly a family of peasants<br/>
<a href="need.htm">need</a>ed at least seventeen to twenty acres to live on the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e of the<br/>
soil--and <a href="we.htm">we</a> know how peasants live--<a href="we.htm">we</a> can now no longer say what is<br/>
the minimum area on which all that is necessary to a family can be<br/>
<a href="grow.htm">grow</a>n, even including articles of luxury, if the soil is <a href="work.htm">work</a>ed by <a href="means.htm">means</a><br/>
of intensive culture.<br/>
<br/>
Twenty years ago it could already be asserted that a population of<br/>
thirty million individuals could live very well, without im<a href="port.htm">port</a>ing<br/>
any<a href="thing.htm">thing</a>, on what could be <a href="grow.htm">grow</a>n in Great Britain. But now, when <a href="we.htm">we</a> see<br/>
the progress recently made in France, in Germany, in Eng<a href="land.htm">land</a>, and when<br/>
<a href="we.htm">we</a> contemp<a href="late.htm">late</a> the <a href="new.htm">new</a> horizons which <a href="open.htm">open</a> before <a href="us.htm">us</a>, <a href="we.htm">we</a> can say that in<br/>
cultivating the earth as it is already cultivated in many places, even<br/>
on poor soils, fifty or sixty million inhabitants to the territory of<br/>
Great Britain would still be a very feeble pro<a href="port.htm">port</a>ion to what man could<br/>
extract from the soil.<br/>
<br/>
In any case <small>(as <a href="we.htm">we</a> are about to demonstrate)</small> <a href="we.htm">we</a> may consider it as<br/>
ab<a href="solu.htm">solu</a>tely proved that if to-morrow Paris and the two departments of<br/>
Seine and of Seine-et-Oise <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nized themselves as an Anarchist <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>e,<br/>
in which all <a href="work.htm">work</a>ed with their hands, and if the entire universe<br/>
refused to send them a single bushel of wheat, a single head of cattle,<br/>
a single basket of fruit, and left them only the territory of the two<br/>
departments, they could not only <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e all the corn, meat, and<br/>
vegetables necessary for themselves, but also vegetables and fruit which<br/>
are now articles of luxury, in sufficient quantities for all.<br/>
<br/>
And, in addition, <a href="we.htm">we</a> affirm that the sum total of this labour would be<br/>
far less than that expended at present to feed these people with corn<br/>
har<a href="vest.htm">vest</a>ed in Auvergne and Russia, with vegetables <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed a little<br/>
everywhere by extensive <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture, and with fruit <a href="grow.htm">grow</a>n in the South.<br/>
<br/>
It is self-evident that <a href="we.htm">we</a> in nowise desire all <a href="exch.htm">exch</a>ange to be<br/>
suppressed, nor that each region should strive to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e that which<br/>
will only <a href="grow.htm">grow</a> in its climate by a more or less artificial culture. But<br/>
<a href="we.htm">we</a> care to draw attention to the fact that the theory of <a href="exch.htm">exch</a>ange, such<br/>
as is understood to-day, is strangely exaggerated--that <a href="exch.htm">exch</a>ange is<br/>
often <a href="use.htm">use</a>less and even harmful. <a href="we.htm">We</a> assert, moreover, that people have<br/>
never had a right conception of the immense labour of Southern <a href="win.htm">win</a>e<br/>
<a href="grow.htm">grow</a>ers, nor that of Russian and Hungarian corn <a href="grow.htm">grow</a>ers, whose excessive<br/>
labour could also be very much reduced if they adopted intensive<br/>
culture, <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ead of their present system of extensive <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
II<br/>
<br/>
It would be impossible to quote here the mass of facts on which <a href="we.htm">we</a> base<br/>
<a href="our.htm">our</a> assertions. <a href="we.htm">We</a> are therefore obliged to refer <a href="our.htm">our</a> readers who <a href="want.htm">want</a><br/>
further <a href="info.htm">info</a>rmation to another book, "Fields, <a href="factor.htm">Factor</a>ies, and<br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a>shops."<small>[11]</small> Above all <a href="we.htm">we</a> earnestly invite those who are <a href="interest.htm">interest</a>ed<br/>
in the question to read several ex<a href="cell.htm">cell</a>ent <a href="work.htm">work</a>s published in France and<br/>
elsewhere, and of which <a href="we.htm">we</a> give a list at the close of this book<small>[12]</small>. As<br/>
to the inhabitants of large towns, who have as yet no real notion of<br/>
what <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture can be, <a href="we.htm">we</a> advise them to explore the surrounding<br/>
market-gardens. They <a href="need.htm">need</a> but ob<a href="serv.htm">serv</a>e and question the market-gardeners,<br/>
and a <a href="new.htm">new</a> world will be <a href="open.htm">open</a> to them. They will then be able to see what<br/>
European <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture may be in the twentieth century; and they will<br/>
understand with what force the social revolution will be armed when <a href="we.htm">we</a><br/>
know the secret of taking every<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> <a href="we.htm">we</a> <a href="need.htm">need</a> from the soil.<br/>
<br/>
A few facts will suffice to show that <a href="our.htm">our</a> assertions are in no way<br/>
exaggerated. <a href="we.htm">We</a> only wish them to be preceded by a few general remarks.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> know in what a wretched condition European <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture is. If the<br/>
cultivator of the soil is not plundered by the <a href="land.htm">land</a><a href="own.htm">own</a>er, he is robbed<br/>
by the State. If the State <a href="tax.htm">tax</a>es him <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>erately, the <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y-lender<br/>
enslaves him by <a href="means.htm">means</a> of <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>sory <a href="note.htm">note</a>s, and soon turns him into the<br/>
simple tenant of soil belonging in reality to a financial company. The<br/>
<a href="land.htm">land</a>lord, the State, and the banker thus plunders the cultivator by<br/>
<a href="means.htm">means</a> of <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>, <a href="tax.htm">tax</a>es, and <a href="interest.htm">interest</a>. The sum varies in each country, but<br/>
it never falls below the quarter, very often the half of the raw<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e. In France and in Italy <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culturists <a href="paid.htm">paid</a> the State quite<br/>
recently as much as 44 per cent. of the gross <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, the <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e of the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er and of State always goes on increasing.<br/>
As soon as the cultivator has obtained more plentiful crops by prodigies<br/>
of labour, invention, or initiative, the tribute he will owe to the<br/>
<a href="land.htm">land</a><a href="own.htm">own</a>er, the State, and the banker will augment in pro<a href="port.htm">port</a>ion. If he<br/>
doubles the number of bushels reaped per acre, <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> will be doubled, and<br/>
<a href="tax.htm">tax</a>es too, and the State will take care to raise them still more if the<br/>
<a href="price.htm">price</a>s go up. And so on. In short, everywhere the cultivator of the soil<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>s twelve to sixteen hours a day; these three vultures take from him<br/>
every<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> he might lay by; they rob him everywhere of what would enable<br/>
him to improve his culture. This is why <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture progresses so<br/>
slowly.<br/>
<br/>
The cultivator can only occasionally <a href="make.htm">make</a> some progress, in some<br/>
exceptional regions, under quite exceptional circumstances, following<br/>
upon a quarrel between the three vampires. And yet <a href="we.htm">we</a> have said no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a><br/>
about the tribute every cultivator <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s to the manufacturer. Every<br/>
machine, every spade, every barrel of chemical manure, is <a href="sold.htm">sold</a> to him at<br/>
three or four <a href="time.htm">time</a>s its real <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>. Nor let <a href="us.htm">us</a> forget the middleman, who<br/>
levies the lion's <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e of the earth's <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
This is why, during all this century of invention and progress,<br/>
<a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture has only improved from <a href="time.htm">time</a> to <a href="time.htm">time</a> on very limited areas.<br/>
<br/>
Happily there have always been small oases, neglected for some <a href="time.htm">time</a> by<br/>
the vulture; and here <a href="we.htm">we</a> learn what intensive <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture can <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e<br/>
for mankind. Let <a href="us.htm">us</a> mention a few examples.<br/>
<br/>
In the American prairies <small>(which, however, only yield meagre spring wheat<br/>
crops, from 7 to 15 bushels acre, and even these are often marred by<br/>
periodical droughts)</small>, 500 men, <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing only during eight months, <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e<br/>
the annual <a href="food.htm">food</a> of 50,000 people. With all the improvements of the last<br/>
three years, one man's y<a href="early.htm">early</a> labour <small>(300 days)</small> yields, delivered in<br/>
Chicago as flour, the y<a href="early.htm">early</a> <a href="food.htm">food</a> of 250 men. Here the result is<br/>
obtained by a great <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy in manual labour: on those vast plains,<br/>
ploughing, har<a href="vest.htm">vest</a>ing, thrashing, are <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nized in almost military<br/>
fashion. There is no <a href="use.htm">use</a>less running to and fro, no loss of <a href="time.htm">time</a>--all is<br/>
done with parade-like precision.<br/>
<br/>
This is <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture on a large scale--extensive <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture, which takes<br/>
the soil from nature without seeking to improve it. When the earth has<br/>
yielded all it can, they leave it; they seek elsewhere for a virgin<br/>
soil, to be exhausted in its turn. But here is also "intensive"<br/>
<a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture, which is already <a href="work.htm">work</a>ed, and will be more and more so, by<br/>
machinery. Its <a href="object.htm">object</a> is to cultivate a limited space well, to manure,<br/>
to improve, to concentrate <a href="work.htm">work</a>, and to obtain the largest crop<br/>
possible. This kind of culture spreads every year, and whereas<br/>
<a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culturists in the south of France and on the fertile plains of<br/>
western America are content with an average crop of 11 to 15 bushels<br/>
per acre by extensive culture, they reap regularly 39, even 55, and<br/>
some<a href="time.htm">time</a>s 60 bushels per acre in the north of France. The annual<br/>
<a href="consum.htm">consum</a>ption of a man is thus obtained from less than a quarter of an<br/>
acre.<br/>
<br/>
And the more intense the culture is, the less <a href="work.htm">work</a> is expended to obtain<br/>
a bushel of wheat. Machinery replaces man at the preliminary <a href="work.htm">work</a> and<br/>
for the improvements <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed by the <a href="land.htm">land</a>--such as draining, clearing of<br/>
stones--which will double the crops in <a href="future.htm">future</a>, once and for ever.<br/>
Some<a href="time.htm">time</a>s no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> but keeping the soil <a href="free.htm">free</a> of weeds, without manuring,<br/>
allows an average soil to yield ex<a href="cell.htm">cell</a>ent crops from year to year. It<br/>
has been done for forty years in succession at <a href="rot.htm">Rot</a>hamstead, in<br/>
Hertfordshire.<br/>
<br/>
However, let <a href="us.htm">us</a> not write an <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>cultural romance, but be satisfied with<br/>
a crop of 44 bushels per acre. That <a href="need.htm">need</a>s no exceptional soil, but<br/>
merely a rational culture; and let <a href="us.htm">us</a> see what it <a href="means.htm">means</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The 3,600,000 individuals who inhabit the two departments of Seine and<br/>
Seine-et-Oise <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>e y<a href="early.htm">early</a> for their <a href="food.htm">food</a> a little less than 22<br/>
million bushels of cereals, chiefly wheat; and in <a href="our.htm">our</a> hypothesis they<br/>
would have to cultivate, in order to obtain this crop, 494,200 acres out<br/>
of the 1,507,300 acres which they possess. It is evident they would not<br/>
cultivate them with spades. That would <a href="need.htm">need</a> too much <a href="time.htm">time</a>--96 <a href="work.htm">work</a>-days<br/>
of 5 hours per acre. It would be preferable to improve the soil once for<br/>
all--to drain what <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed draining, to level what <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed levelling, to<br/>
clear the soil of stones, were it even necessary to spend 5 million days<br/>
of 5 hours in this preparatory <a href="work.htm">work</a>--an average of 10 <a href="work.htm">work</a>-days to each<br/>
acre.<br/>
<br/>
Then they would plough with the s<a href="team.htm">team</a>-digger, which would take one and<br/>
three-fifths of a day per acre, and they would give another one and<br/>
three-fifths of a day for <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing with the double plough. Seeds would be<br/>
<a href="sort.htm">sort</a>ed by s<a href="team.htm">team</a> <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ead of taken haphazard, and they would be carefully<br/>
sown in rows <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ead of being thrown to the four <a href="win.htm">win</a>ds. Now all this<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a> would not take 10 days of 5 hours per acre if the <a href="work.htm">work</a> were done<br/>
under <a href="good.htm">good</a> conditions. But if 10 million <a href="work.htm">work</a>-days are given to <a href="good.htm">good</a><br/>
culture during 3 or 4 years, the result will be that <a href="late.htm">late</a>r on crops of<br/>
44 to 55 bushels per acre will be obtained by only <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing half the<br/>
<a href="time.htm">time</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Fifteen million <a href="work.htm">work</a>-days will thus have been spent to give <a href="bread.htm">bread</a> to a<br/>
population of 3,600,000 inhabitants. And the <a href="work.htm">work</a> would be such that<br/>
everyone could do it without having muscles of steel, or without having<br/>
even <a href="work.htm">work</a>ed the ground before. The initiative and the general<br/>
distribution of <a href="work.htm">work</a> would come from those who know the soil. As to the<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a> itself, there is no townsman of either sex so enfeebled as to be<br/>
incapable of looking after machines and of contributing his <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e to<br/>
agrarian <a href="work.htm">work</a> after a few hours' app<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>iceship.<br/>
<br/>
Well, when <a href="we.htm">we</a> consider that in the present chaos there are, in a city<br/>
like Paris, without counting the un<a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ed of the upper <a href="class.htm">class</a>es, there<br/>
are always about 100,000 <a href="work.htm">work</a>men out of <a href="work.htm">work</a> in their several <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>es, <a href="we.htm">we</a><br/>
see that the power lost in <a href="our.htm">our</a> present <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization would alone suffice<br/>
to give, with a rational culture, all the <a href="bread.htm">bread</a> that is necessary for<br/>
the three or four million inhabitants of the two departments.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> repeat, this is no fancy dream, and <a href="we.htm">we</a> have not yet spoken of the<br/>
truly intensive <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture. <a href="we.htm">We</a> have not depended upon the wheat<br/>
<small>(obtained in three years by Mr. Hallett)</small> of which one grain, <a href="replant.htm">replant</a>ed,<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed 5,000 or 6,000, and occasionally 10,000 grains, which would<br/>
give the wheat necessary for a family of five individuals on an area of<br/>
120 square yards. On the contrary, <a href="we.htm">we</a> have only mentioned what is being<br/>
already achieved by numerous <a href="farm.htm">farm</a>ers in France, Eng<a href="land.htm">land</a>, Belgium, etc.,<br/>
and what might be done to-morrow with the experience and knowledge<br/>
acquired already by practice on a large scale.<br/>
<br/>
But without a revolution, neither to-morrow, nor after to-morrow will<br/>
see it done, because it is not to the <a href="interest.htm">interest</a> of <a href="land.htm">land</a><a href="own.htm">own</a>ers and<br/>
<a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ists; and because peasants who would find their <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> in it have<br/>
neither the knowledge nor the <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y, nor the <a href="time.htm">time</a> to obtain what is<br/>
necessary to go ahead.<br/>
<br/>
The society of to-day has not yet reached this stage. But let Parisians<br/>
proclaim an Anarchist <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>e, and they will of necessity come to it,<br/>
because they will not be foolish enough to continue making luxurious<br/>
toys <small>(which Vienna, Warsaw, and Berlin <a href="make.htm">make</a> as well already)</small>, and to run<br/>
the risk of being left without <a href="bread.htm">bread</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>cultural <a href="work.htm">work</a>, by the help of machinery, would soon become<br/>
the most attractive and the most joyful of all occupations.<br/>
<br/>
"<a href="we.htm">We</a> have had enough jewelery and enough dolls' <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>es," they would say;<br/>
"it is high <a href="time.htm">time</a> for the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers to recruit their strength in<br/>
<a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture, to go in search of vigour, of impressions of nature, of the<br/>
joy of life, that they have forgotten in the dark <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies of the<br/>
suburbs."<br/>
<br/>
In the Middle Ages it was Alpine <a href="past.htm">past</a>ure <a href="land.htm">land</a>s, rather than guns, which<br/>
allowed the Swiss to shake off lords and kings. <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>ern <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture will<br/>
allow a city in revolt to <a href="free.htm">free</a> itself from the combined bourgeois<br/>
forces.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
III<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> have seen how the three and one-half million inhabitants of the two<br/>
departments round Paris could find ample <a href="bread.htm">bread</a> by cultivating only a<br/>
third of their territory. Let <a href="us.htm">us</a> now <a href="pass.htm">pass</a> on to cattle.<br/>
<br/>
Englishmen, who <a href="eat.htm">eat</a> much meat, <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>e on an average a little less than<br/>
220 pounds a year per adult. Supposing all meats <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>ed were oxen,<br/>
that <a href="make.htm">make</a>s a little less than the third of an ox. An ox a year for five<br/>
individuals <small>(including children)</small> is already a sufficient ration. For<br/>
three and one-half million inhabitants this would <a href="make.htm">make</a> an annual<br/>
<a href="consum.htm">consum</a>ption of 700,000 head of cattle.<br/>
<br/>
To-day, with the <a href="past.htm">past</a>ure system, <a href="we.htm">we</a> <a href="need.htm">need</a> at least five million acres to<br/>
nourish 660,000 head of cattle. This <a href="make.htm">make</a>s nine acres per each head of<br/>
horned cattle. Ne<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>heless, with prairies <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>erately <a href="water.htm">water</a>ed by spring<br/>
<a href="water.htm">water</a> <small>(as recently done on thousands of acres in the southwest of<br/>
France)</small>, one and one-fourth million acres already suffice. But if<br/>
intensive culture is practiced, and beet-root is <a href="grow.htm">grow</a>n for fodder, you<br/>
only <a href="need.htm">need</a> a quarter of that area, that is to say, about 310,000 acres.<br/>
And if <a href="we.htm">we</a> have recourse to maize and practice ensilage <small>(the compression<br/>
of fodder while green)</small> like Arabs, <a href="we.htm">we</a> obtain fodder on an area of<br/>
217,500 acres.<br/>
<br/>
In the environs of Milan, where sewer <a href="water.htm">water</a> is <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to irrigate the<br/>
fields, fodder for two to three horned cattle per each acre is obtained<br/>
on an area of 22,000 acres; and on a few favoured fields, up to 177 tons<br/>
of hay to the 10 acres have been cropped, the y<a href="early.htm">early</a> provender of 36<br/>
milch cows. N<a href="early.htm">early</a> nine acres per head of cattle are <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed under the<br/>
<a href="past.htm">past</a>ure system, and only two and one-half acres for nine oxen or cows<br/>
under the <a href="new.htm">new</a> system. These are the opposite extremes in <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern<br/>
<a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture.<br/>
<br/>
In Guernsey, on a total of 9,884 acres utilized, n<a href="early.htm">early</a> half <small>(4,695<br/>
acres)</small> are covered with cereals and kitchen-gardens; only 5,189 acres<br/>
remain as meadows. On these 5,189 acres, 1,480 horses, 7,260 head of<br/>
cattle, 900 sheep, and 4,200 pigs are fed, which <a href="make.htm">make</a>s more than three<br/>
head of cattle per two acres, without reckoning the sheep or the pigs.<br/>
It is <a href="need.htm">need</a>less to add that the fertility of the soil is made by seaweed<br/>
and chemical manures.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="return.htm">Return</a>ing to <a href="our.htm">our</a> three and one-half million inhabitants belonging to<br/>
Paris and its environs, <a href="we.htm">we</a> see that the <a href="land.htm">land</a> necessary for the rearing<br/>
of cattle comes down from five million acres to 197,000. Well, then, let<br/>
<a href="us.htm">us</a> not stop at the lowest figures, let <a href="us.htm">us</a> take those of ordinary<br/>
intensive culture; let <a href="us.htm">us</a> liberally add to the <a href="land.htm">land</a> necessary for<br/>
smaller cattle which <a href="must.htm">must</a> replace some of the horned beasts and allow<br/>
395,000 acres for the rearing of cattle--494,000 if you like, on the<br/>
1,013,000 acres remaining after <a href="bread.htm">bread</a> has been provided for the people.<br/>
<br/>
Let <a href="us.htm">us</a> be generous and give five million <a href="work.htm">work</a>-days to put this <a href="land.htm">land</a> into<br/>
a <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive state.<br/>
<br/>
After having therefore <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ed in the course of a year twenty million<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>-days, half of which are for permanent improvements, <a href="we.htm">we</a> shall have<br/>
<a href="bread.htm">bread</a> and meat <a href="assur.htm">assur</a>ed to <a href="us.htm">us</a>, without including all the extra meat<br/>
obtainable in the shape of fowls, pigs, rabbits, etc.; without taking<br/>
into consideration that a population provided with ex<a href="cell.htm">cell</a>ent vegetables<br/>
and fruit <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>es less meat than Englishmen, who supplement their poor<br/>
supply of vegetables by <a href="animal.htm">animal</a> <a href="food.htm">food</a>. Now, how much do twenty million<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>-days of five hours <a href="make.htm">make</a> per inhabitant? Very little indeed. A<br/>
population of three and one-half millions <a href="must.htm">must</a> have at least 1,200,000<br/>
adult men, and as many women capable of <a href="work.htm">work</a>. Well, then, to give <a href="bread.htm">bread</a><br/>
and meat to all, it would <a href="need.htm">need</a> only seventeen half-days of <a href="work.htm">work</a> a year<br/>
per man. Add three million <a href="work.htm">work</a>-days, or double that number if you like,<br/>
in order to obtain milk. That will <a href="make.htm">make</a> twenty-five <a href="work.htm">work</a>-days of five<br/>
hours in all--no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> more than a little pleasureable country<br/>
exercise--to obtain the three principal <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts: <a href="bread.htm">bread</a>, meat, and milk.<br/>
The three <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts which, after housing, cause daily anxiety to<br/>
nine-tenths of mankind.<br/>
<br/>
And yet--let <a href="us.htm">us</a> not tire of repeating--these are not fancy dreams. <a href="we.htm">We</a><br/>
have only told what is, what been, obtained by experience on a large<br/>
scale. <a href="agri.htm">Agri</a>culture could be re<a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nized in this way to-morrow if<br/>
<a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="law.htm">law</a>s and general ignorance did not offer opposition.<br/>
<br/>
The day Paris has understood that to know what you <a href="eat.htm">eat</a> and how it is<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed, is a question of public <a href="interest.htm">interest</a>; the day when everybody will<br/>
have understood that this question is infinitely more im<a href="port.htm">port</a>ant than all<br/>
the parliamentary debates of the present <a href="time.htm">time</a>s--on that day the<br/>
Revolution will be an accomplished fact. Paris will take possession of<br/>
the two departments and cultivate them. And then the Parisian <a href="work.htm">work</a>er,<br/>
after having laboured a third of his existence in order to <a href="buy.htm">buy</a> bad and<br/>
insufficient <a href="food.htm">food</a>, will <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e it himself, under his <a href="wall.htm">wall</a>s, within the<br/>
enclosure of his forts <small>(if they still exist)</small>, and in a few hours of<br/>
<a href="heal.htm">heal</a>thy and attractive <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
And now <a href="we.htm">we</a> <a href="pass.htm">pass</a> on to fruit and vegetables. Let <a href="us.htm">us</a> go outside Paris and<br/>
visit the establishment of a market-gardener who accomplishes wonders<br/>
<small>(ignored by learned <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omists)</small> at a few miles from the academies.<br/>
<br/>
Let <a href="us.htm">us</a> visit, suppose, M. Ponce, the author of a <a href="work.htm">work</a> on<br/>
market-gardening, who <a href="make.htm">make</a>s no secret of what the earth yields him, and<br/>
who has published it all along.<br/>
<br/>
M. Ponce, and especially his <a href="work.htm">work</a>men, <a href="work.htm">work</a> like niggers. It takes eight<br/>
men to cultivate a plot a little less than three acres <small>(2.7)</small>. They <a href="work.htm">work</a><br/>
twelve and even fifteen hours a day, that is to say, three <a href="time.htm">time</a>s more<br/>
than is <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed. Twenty-four of them would not be too many. To which M.<br/>
Ponce will probably answer that as he <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s the terrible sum of £100 <a href="rent.htm">rent</a><br/>
a year for his 2.7 acres of <a href="land.htm">land</a>, and £100 for manure bought in the<br/>
barracks, he is obliged to exploit. He would no doubt answer, "Being<br/>
exploited, I exploit in my turn." His <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>allation has also <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> him<br/>
£1,200, of which certainly more than half went as tribute to the idle<br/>
barons of industry. In reality, this establishment represents at most<br/>
3,000 <a href="work.htm">work</a>-days, probably much less.<br/>
<br/>
But let <a href="us.htm">us</a> examine his crops: n<a href="early.htm">early</a> ten tons of carrots, n<a href="early.htm">early</a> ten<br/>
tons of onions, radishes, and small vegetables, 6,000 heads of cabbage,<br/>
3,000 heads of cauliflower, 5,000 baskets of tomatoes, 5,000 dozen of<br/>
choice fruit, 154,000 salads; in short, a total of 123 tons of<br/>
vegetables and fruit to 2.7 acres--120 yards long by 109 yards broad,<br/>
which <a href="make.htm">make</a>s more than forty-four tons of vegetables to the acre.<br/>
<br/>
But a man does not <a href="eat.htm">eat</a> more than 660 pounds of vegetables and fruit a<br/>
year, and two and one-half acres of a market-garden yield enough<br/>
vegetables and fruit to richly supply the table of 350 adults during the<br/>
year. Thus twenty-four <a href="person.htm">person</a>s <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ed a whole year in cultivating 2.7<br/>
acres of <a href="land.htm">land</a>, and only five <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing hours a day, would <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e<br/>
sufficient vegetables and fruit for 350 adults, which is equivalent at<br/>
least to 500 individuals.<br/>
<br/>
To put it another way: in cultivating like M. Ponce--and his results<br/>
have already been sur<a href="pass.htm">pass</a>ed--350 adults should each give a little more<br/>
than 100 hours a year <small>(103)</small> to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e vegetables and fruit necessary<br/>
for 500 people.<br/>
<br/>
Let <a href="us.htm">us</a> mention that such a <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion is not the exception. It takes<br/>
place, under the <a href="wall.htm">wall</a>s of Paris, on an area of 2,220 acres, by 5,000<br/>
market-gardeners. Only these market-gardeners are reduced nowadays to a<br/>
state of beasts of burden, in order to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> an average <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> of £32 per<br/>
acre.<br/>
<br/>
But do not these facts, which can be verified by every one, prove that<br/>
17,300 acres <small>(of the 519,000 remaining to <a href="us.htm">us</a>)</small> would suffice to give all<br/>
necessary vegetables, as well as a liberal amount of fruit to the three<br/>
and one-half million inhabitants of <a href="our.htm">our</a> two departments?<br/>
<br/>
As to the quantity of <a href="work.htm">work</a> necessary to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e these fruits and<br/>
vegetables, it would amount to fifty million <a href="work.htm">work</a>-days of five hours <small>(50<br/>
days per adult male)</small>, if <a href="we.htm">we</a> measure by the market-gardeners' standard of<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>. But <a href="we.htm">we</a> could reduce this quantity if <a href="we.htm">we</a> had recourse to the<br/>
process in vogue in Jersey and Guernsey. <a href="we.htm">We</a> <a href="must.htm">must</a> also remember that the<br/>
Paris market-gardener is forced to <a href="work.htm">work</a> so hard because he mostly<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>es <a href="early.htm">early</a> season fruits, the high <a href="price.htm">price</a>s of which have to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for<br/>
fabulous <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>s, and that this system of culture entails more <a href="work.htm">work</a> than<br/>
is necessary for <a href="grow.htm">grow</a>ing the ordinary staple-<a href="food.htm">food</a> vegetables and fruit.<br/>
Besides, the market-gardeners of Paris, not having the <a href="means.htm">means</a> to <a href="make.htm">make</a> a<br/>
great outlay on their gardens, and being obliged to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> heavily for<br/>
glass, wood, iron, and coal, obtain their artificial heat out of manure,<br/>
while it can be had at much less <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> in hothouses.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
IV<br/>
<br/>
The market-gardeners, <a href="we.htm">we</a> say, are forced to become machines and to<br/>
renounce all joys of life in order to obtain their marvellous crops. But<br/>
these hard grinders have rendered a great <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ice to humanity in<br/>
teaching <a href="us.htm">us</a> that the soil can be "made." They _<a href="make.htm">make</a>_ it with <a href="old.htm">old</a><br/>
hot-beds of manure, which have already <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ed to give the necessary<br/>
warmth to young <a href="plant.htm">plant</a>s and to <a href="early.htm">early</a> fruit; and they <a href="make.htm">make</a> it in such<br/>
great quantity that they are compelled to <a href="sell.htm">sell</a> it in part, otherwise it<br/>
would raise the level of their gardens by one inch every year. They do<br/>
it so well <small>(so Barral teaches <a href="us.htm">us</a>, in his "Dictionary of <a href="agri.htm">Agri</a>culture," in<br/>
an article on market-gardeners)</small> that in recent contracts, the<br/>
market-gardener stipu<a href="late.htm">late</a>s that he will <a href="carry.htm">carry</a> away his soil with him<br/>
when he leaves the bit of ground he is cultivating. Loam carried away on<br/>
carts, with furniture and glass frames--that is the answer of practical<br/>
cultivators to the learned treatises of a Ricardo, who represented <a href="rent.htm">rent</a><br/>
as a <a href="means.htm">means</a> of equalizing the natural advantages of the soil. "The soil<br/>
is <a href="worth.htm">worth</a> what the man is <a href="worth.htm">worth</a>," that is the gardeners' motto.<br/>
<br/>
And yet the market-gardeners of Paris and Rouen labour three <a href="time.htm">time</a>s as<br/>
hard to obtain the same results as their fellow-<a href="work.htm">work</a>ers in Guernsey or<br/>
in Eng<a href="land.htm">land</a>. Applying industry to <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture, these last <a href="make.htm">make</a> their<br/>
climate in addition to their soil, by <a href="means.htm">means</a> of the greenhouse.<br/>
<br/>
Fifty years ago the greenhouse was the luxury of the rich. It was kept<br/>
to <a href="grow.htm">grow</a> exotic <a href="plant.htm">plant</a>s for pleasure. But nowadays its <a href="use.htm">use</a> begins to be<br/>
generalized. A tremendous industry has <a href="grow.htm">grow</a>n up <a href="late.htm">late</a>ly in Guernsey and<br/>
Jersey, where hundreds of acres are already covered with glass--to say<br/>
no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> of the countless small greenhouses kept in every little <a href="farm.htm">farm</a><br/>
garden. Acres and acres of greenhouses have <a href="late.htm">late</a>ly been built also at<br/>
<a href="worth.htm">Worth</a>ing <small>(103 acres in 1912)</small>, in the suburbs of London, and in several<br/>
other parts of Eng<a href="land.htm">land</a> and Scot<a href="land.htm">land</a>.<br/>
<br/>
They are built of all qualities, beginning with those which have granite<br/>
<a href="wall.htm">wall</a>s, down to those which represent mere <a href="shelter.htm">shelter</a>s made in <a href="plan.htm">plan</a>ks and<br/>
glass frames, which <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>, even now, with all the tribute <a href="paid.htm">paid</a> to<br/>
<a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ists and middlemen, less than 3s. 6d. per square yard under<br/>
glass. Most of them are heated for at least three of four months every<br/>
year; but even the cool greenhouses, which are not heated at all, give<br/>
ex<a href="cell.htm">cell</a>ent results--of course, not for <a href="grow.htm">grow</a>ing grapes and tropical<br/>
<a href="plant.htm">plant</a>s, but for potatoes, carrots, peas, tomatoes, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
In this way man emancipates himself from climate, and at the same <a href="time.htm">time</a><br/>
he avoids also the heavy <a href="work.htm">work</a> with the hot-beds, and he saves <a href="bot.htm">bot</a>h in<br/>
<a href="buy.htm">buy</a>ing much less manure and in <a href="work.htm">work</a>. Three men to the acre, each of them<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>ing less than sixty hours a week, <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e on very small spaces what<br/>
formerly required acres and acres of <a href="land.htm">land</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The result of all these recent conquests of culture is, that if one-half<br/>
only of the adults of a city gave each about fifty half-days for the<br/>
culture of the finest fruit and vegetables _out of season_, they would<br/>
have all the year round an unlimited supply of that <a href="sort.htm">sort</a> of fruit and<br/>
vegetables for the whole population.<br/>
<br/>
But there is a still more im<a href="port.htm">port</a>ant fact to notice. The greenhouse has<br/>
nowadays a tendency to become a mere _kitchen garden under glass_. And<br/>
when it is <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to such a purpose, the simplest <a href="plan.htm">plan</a>k-and-glass unheated<br/>
<a href="shelter.htm">shelter</a>s already give fabulous crops--such as, for <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ance, 500 bushels<br/>
of potatoes per acre as a first crop, ready by the end of April; after<br/>
which a s<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>d and a third crop are obtained in the extremely high<br/>
temperature which prevails in the summer under glass.<br/>
<br/>
I gave in my "Fields, <a href="factor.htm">Factor</a>ies, and <a href="work.htm">Work</a>shops," most striking facts in<br/>
this direction. Sufficient to say here, that at Jersey, thirty-four men,<br/>
with one trained gardener only, cultivate thirteen acres under glass,<br/>
from which they obtain 143 tons of fruit and <a href="early.htm">early</a> vegetables, using for<br/>
this extraordinary culture less than 1,000 tons of coal.<br/>
<br/>
And this is done now in Guernsey and Jersey on a very large scale, quite<br/>
a number of s<a href="team.htm">team</a>ers constantly plying between Guernsey and London, only<br/>
to ex<a href="port.htm">port</a> the crops of the greenhouses.<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays, in order to obtain that same crop of 500 bushels of potatoes,<br/>
<a href="we.htm">we</a> <a href="must.htm">must</a> plough every year a surface of four acres, <a href="plant.htm">plant</a> it, cultivate<br/>
it, weed, it, and so on; whereas with the glass, even if <a href="we.htm">we</a> shall have<br/>
to give perhaps, to <a href="star.htm">star</a>t with, half a day's <a href="work.htm">work</a> per square yard in<br/>
order to build the greenhouse--<a href="we.htm">we</a> shall save afterwards at least<br/>
one-half, and probably three-quarters of the y<a href="early.htm">early</a> labour required<br/>
formerly.<br/>
<br/>
These are _facts_, results which every one can verify himself. And these<br/>
facts are already a hint as to what man could obtain from the earth if<br/>
he treated it with intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
V<br/>
<br/>
In all the above <a href="we.htm">we</a> have reasoned upon what already withstood the test<br/>
of experience. Intensive culture of the fields, irrigated meadows, the<br/>
hot-house, and finally the kitchen garden under glass are realities.<br/>
Moreover, the tendency is to extend and to generalize these methods of<br/>
culture, because they allow of obtaining more <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e with less <a href="work.htm">work</a> and<br/>
with more certainty.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, after having studied the most simple glass <a href="shelter.htm">shelter</a>s of<br/>
Guernsey, <a href="we.htm">we</a> affirm that, taking all in all, far less <a href="work.htm">work</a> is expended<br/>
for obtaining potatoes under glass in April, than in <a href="grow.htm">grow</a>ing them in the<br/>
<a href="open.htm">open</a> air, which requires digging a space four <a href="time.htm">time</a>s as large, <a href="water.htm">water</a>ing<br/>
it, weeding it, etc. <a href="work.htm">Work</a> is likewise <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omized in <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ing a<br/>
perfected tool or machine, even when an initial expense had to be<br/>
incurred to <a href="buy.htm">buy</a> the tool.<br/>
<br/>
Complete figures concerning the culture of <a href="common.htm">common</a> vegetables under glass<br/>
are still <a href="want.htm">want</a>ing. This culture is of recent origin, and is only carried<br/>
out on small areas. But <a href="we.htm">we</a> have already figures concerning the fifty<br/>
years <a href="old.htm">old</a> culture of <a href="early.htm">early</a> season grapes, and these figures are<br/>
conclusive.<br/>
<br/>
In the north of Eng<a href="land.htm">land</a>, on the Scotch frontier, where coal only <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s<br/>
3s. a ton at the pit's mouth, they have long since taken to <a href="grow.htm">grow</a>ing<br/>
hot-house grapes. Thirty years ago these grapes, ripe in January, were<br/>
<a href="sold.htm">sold</a> by the <a href="grow.htm">grow</a>er at 20s. per pound and re<a href="sold.htm">sold</a> at 40s. per pound for<br/>
Napoleon III.'s table. To-day the same <a href="grow.htm">grow</a>er <a href="sell.htm">sell</a>s them at only 2s. 6d.<br/>
per pound. He tells <a href="us.htm">us</a> so himself in a horticultural journal. The fall<br/>
in the <a href="price.htm">price</a>s is caused by the tons and tons of grapes arriving in<br/>
January to London and Paris.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to the cheapness of coal and an intelligent culture, grapes from<br/>
the north travel now southwards, in a contrary direction to ordinary<br/>
fruit. They <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> so little that in May, English and Jersey grapes are<br/>
<a href="sold.htm">sold</a> at 1s. 8d. per pound by the gardeners, and yet this <a href="price.htm">price</a>, like<br/>
that of 40s. thirty years ago, is only kept up by slack <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
In March, Belgium grapes are <a href="sold.htm">sold</a> at from 6d. to 8d., while in October,<br/>
grapes cultivated in immense quantities--under glass, and with a little<br/>
artificial heating in the environs of London--are <a href="sold.htm">sold</a> at the same <a href="price.htm">price</a><br/>
as grapes bought by the pound in the vineyards of Switzer<a href="land.htm">land</a> and the<br/>
Rhine, that is to say, for a few halfpence. Yet they still <a href="cost.htm">cost</a><br/>
two-thirds too much, by reason of the excessive <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> of the soil and the<br/>
<a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>allation and heating, on which the gardener <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s a<br/>
formidable tribute to the manufacturer and the middleman. This being<br/>
understood, <a href="we.htm">we</a> may say that it <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s "next to no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a>" to have delicious<br/>
grapes under the latitude of, and in <a href="our.htm">our</a> misty London in autumn. In one<br/>
of the suburbs, for <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ance, a wretched glass and plaster <a href="shelter.htm">shelter</a>, nine<br/>
feet ten inches long by six and one-half feet wide, resting aga<a href="inst.htm">inst</a> <a href="our.htm">our</a><br/>
cottage, gave <a href="us.htm">us</a> about fifty pounds of grapes of an exquisite flavour in<br/>
October, for nine consecutive years. The crop came from a Hamburg<br/>
vine-stalk, six year <a href="old.htm">old</a>. And the <a href="shelter.htm">shelter</a> was so bad that the rain came<br/>
through. At night the temperature was always that of outside. It was<br/>
evidently not heated, for it would have been as <a href="use.htm">use</a>less as heating the<br/>
street! And the care which was given was: pruning the vine, half an hour<br/>
every year; and bringing a wheel-barrowful of manure, which was thrown<br/>
over the stalk of the vine, <a href="plant.htm">plant</a>ed in red clay outside the <a href="shelter.htm">shelter</a>.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, if <a href="we.htm">we</a> estimate the amount of care given to the vine<br/>
on the borders of the Rhine of Lake Leman, the terraces constructed<br/>
stone upon stone on the slopes of the hills, the <a href="trans.htm">trans</a><a href="port.htm">port</a> of manure and<br/>
also of earth to a height of two or three hundred feet, <a href="we.htm">we</a> come to the<br/>
conclusion that on the whole the expenditure of <a href="work.htm">work</a> necessary to<br/>
cultivate vines is more considerable in Switzer<a href="land.htm">land</a> or on the banks of<br/>
the Rhine than it is under glass in London suburbs.<br/>
<br/>
This may seem paradoxical, because it is generally believed that vines<br/>
<a href="grow.htm">grow</a> of themselves in the south of Europe, and that the vine-<a href="grow.htm">grow</a>er's<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a> <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a>. But gardeners and horticulturists, far from<br/>
con<a href="trad.htm">trad</a>icting <a href="us.htm">us</a>, confirm <a href="our.htm">our</a> assertions. "The most advantageous culture<br/>
in Eng<a href="land.htm">land</a> is vine culture," wrote a practical gardener, editor of the<br/>
"English Journal of Horticulture" in the _Nineteenth Century_. <a href="price.htm">Price</a>s<br/>
speak eloquently for themselves, as <a href="we.htm">we</a> know.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="trans.htm">Trans</a>lating these facts into <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ist <a href="lang.htm">lang</a>uage, <a href="we.htm">we</a> may assert that the<br/>
man or woman who takes twenty hours a year from his leisure <a href="time.htm">time</a> to give<br/>
some little care--very pleasant in the main--to two or three vine-stalks<br/>
<a href="shelter.htm">shelter</a>ed by simple glass under any European climate, will <a href="gath.htm">gath</a>er as<br/>
many grapes as their family and friends can <a href="eat.htm">eat</a>. And that applies not<br/>
only to vines, but to all fruit trees.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="commun.htm">Commun</a>e that will put the processes of intensive culture into<br/>
practice on a large scale will have all possible vegetables, indigenous<br/>
or exotic, and all desirable fruits, without <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ing more than about<br/>
ten hours a year per inhabitant.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> would be easier than to verify the above statements by<br/>
direct experiment. Suppose 100 acres of a light loam <small>(such as <a href="we.htm">we</a> have at<br/>
<a href="worth.htm">Worth</a>ing)</small> are <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>formed into a number of market gardens, each one with<br/>
its glass houses for the rearing of the seedlings and young <a href="plant.htm">plant</a>s.<br/>
Suppose also that fifty more acres are covered with glass houses, and<br/>
the <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization of the whole is left to practical experienced French<br/>
_maraîchers_, and Guernsey or <a href="worth.htm">Worth</a>ing greenhouse gardeners.<br/>
<br/>
In basing the maintenance of these 150 acres on the Jersey average,<br/>
requiring the <a href="work.htm">work</a> of three men per acre under glass--which <a href="make.htm">make</a>s less<br/>
than 8,600 hours of <a href="work.htm">work</a> a year--it would <a href="need.htm">need</a> about 1,300,000 hours for<br/>
the 150 acres. Fifty competent gardeners could give five hours a day to<br/>
this <a href="work.htm">work</a>, and the rest would be simply done by people who, without<br/>
being gardeners by profession, would soon learn how to <a href="use.htm">use</a> a spade, and<br/>
to handle the <a href="plant.htm">plant</a>s. But this <a href="work.htm">work</a> would yield at least--<a href="we.htm">we</a> have seen<br/>
it in a preceding chapter--all necessaries and articles of luxury in the<br/>
way of fruit and vegetables for at least 40,000 or 50,000 people. Let <a href="us.htm">us</a><br/>
admit that among this number there are 13,500 adults, willing to <a href="work.htm">work</a> at<br/>
the kitchen garden; then, each one would have to give 100 hours a year<br/>
distributed over the whole year. These hours of <a href="work.htm">work</a> would become hours<br/>
of re<a href="creat.htm">creat</a>ion spent among friends and children in beautiful gardens,<br/>
more beautiful probably than those of the legendary Semiramis.<br/>
<br/>
This is the balance sheet of the labour to be spent in order to be able<br/>
to <a href="eat.htm">eat</a> to satiety fruit which <a href="we.htm">we</a> are deprived of to-day, and to have<br/>
vegetables in <a href="abund.htm">abund</a>ance, now so scrupulously rationed out by the<br/>
housewife, when she has to reckon each half-penny which <a href="must.htm">must</a> go to<br/>
enrich <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ists and <a href="land.htm">land</a><a href="own.htm">own</a>ers<small>[13]</small>.<br/>
<br/>
If only humanity had the consciousness of what it CAN, and if that<br/>
consciousness only gave it the power to WILL!<br/>
<br/>
If it only knew that cowardice of the spirit is the rock on which all<br/>
revolutions have stranded until now.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
VI<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> can easily perceive the <a href="new.htm">new</a> horizons <a href="open.htm">open</a>ing before the social<br/>
revolution.<br/>
<br/>
Each <a href="time.htm">time</a> <a href="we.htm">we</a> speak of revolution, the face of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er who has seen<br/>
children <a href="want.htm">want</a>ing <a href="food.htm">food</a> darkens and he asks--"What of <a href="bread.htm">bread</a>? Will there be<br/>
sufficient, if everyone <a href="eat.htm">eat</a>s according to his appetite? What if the<br/>
peasants, ignorant tools of reaction, <a href="star.htm">star</a>ve <a href="our.htm">our</a> towns as the black<br/>
bands did in France in 1793--what shall <a href="we.htm">we</a> do?"<br/>
<br/>
Let them do their worst. The large cities will have to do without them.<br/>
<br/>
At what, then, should the hundreds of thousands of <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers, who are<br/>
asphyxiated to-day in small <a href="work.htm">work</a>shops and <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies, be <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ed on the<br/>
day they regain their liberty? Will they continue to shut themselves up<br/>
in <a href="factor.htm">factor</a>ies after the Revolution? Will they continue to <a href="make.htm">make</a> luxurious<br/>
toys for ex<a href="port.htm">port</a> when they see their stock or corn getting exhausted,<br/>
meat becoming <a href="scarc.htm">scarc</a>e, and vegetables disappearing without being<br/>
replaced?<br/>
<br/>
Evidently not! They will leave the town and go into the fields! Aided by<br/>
a machinery which will enable the weakest of <a href="us.htm">us</a> to put a shoulder to<br/>
the wheel, they will <a href="carry.htm">carry</a> revolution into previously enslaved culture<br/>
as they will have carried it into <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>itutions and ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Hundreds of acres will be covered with glass, and men, and women with<br/>
delicate fingers, will foster the <a href="grow.htm">grow</a>th of young <a href="plant.htm">plant</a>s. Hundreds of<br/>
other acres will be ploughed by s<a href="team.htm">team</a>, improved by manures, or enriched<br/>
by artificial soil obtained by the pulverization of rocks. Happy <a href="crowd.htm">crowd</a>s<br/>
of occasional labourers will cover these acres with crops, guided in the<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a> and experiments partly by those who know <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture, but<br/>
especially by the great and practical spirit of a people roused from<br/>
long slumber and illumined by that bright beacon--the happiness of all.<br/>
<br/>
And in two or three months the <a href="early.htm">early</a> crops will receive the most<br/>
pressing <a href="want.htm">want</a>s, and provide <a href="food.htm">food</a> for a people who, after so many<br/>
centuries of expectation, will at least be able to appease their hunger<br/>
and <a href="eat.htm">eat</a> according to their appetite.<br/>
<br/>
In the meanwhile, popular genius, the genius of a nation which revolts<br/>
and knows its <a href="want.htm">want</a>s, will <a href="work.htm">work</a> at experimenting with <a href="new.htm">new</a> processes of<br/>
culture that <a href="we.htm">we</a> already catch a glimpse of, and that only <a href="need.htm">need</a> the<br/>
baptism of experience to become universal. Light will be experimented<br/>
with--that unknown agent of culture which <a href="make.htm">make</a>s barley ripen in<br/>
forty-five days under the latitude of Yakutsk; light, concentrated or<br/>
artificial, will rival heat in hastening the <a href="grow.htm">grow</a>th of <a href="plant.htm">plant</a>s. A Mouchot<br/>
of the <a href="future.htm">future</a> will invent a machine to guide the rays of the <a href="sun.htm">sun</a> and<br/>
<a href="make.htm">make</a> them <a href="work.htm">work</a>, so that <a href="we.htm">we</a> shall no longer seek <a href="sun.htm">sun</a>-heat stored in coal<br/>
in the depths of the earth. They will experiment the <a href="water.htm">water</a>ing of the<br/>
soil with cultures of micro-<a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nisms--a rational idea, conceived but<br/>
yesterday, which will permit <a href="us.htm">us</a> to give to the soil those little living<br/>
beings, necessary to feed the rootlets, to decompose and assimi<a href="late.htm">late</a> the<br/>
component parts of the soil.<br/>
<br/>
They will experiment.... But let <a href="us.htm">us</a> stop here, or <a href="we.htm">we</a> shall enter into<br/>
the realm of fancy. Let <a href="us.htm">us</a> remain in the reality of acquired facts. With<br/>
the processes of culture in <a href="use.htm">use</a>, applied on a large scale, and already<br/>
victorious in the struggle aga<a href="inst.htm">inst</a> industrial competition, <a href="we.htm">we</a> can give<br/>
<a href="our.htm">our</a>selves ease and luxury in <a href="return.htm">return</a> for <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>able <a href="work.htm">work</a>. The near <a href="future.htm">future</a><br/>
will show what is practical in the processes that recent scientific<br/>
discoveries give <a href="us.htm">us</a> a glimpse of. Let <a href="us.htm">us</a> limit <a href="our.htm">our</a>selves at present to<br/>
<a href="open.htm">open</a>ing up the <a href="new.htm">new</a> path that consists in _the study of the <a href="need.htm">need</a>s of man,<br/>
and the <a href="means.htm">means</a> of satisfying them_.<br/>
<br/>
The only <a href="thing.htm">thing</a> that may be <a href="want.htm">want</a>ing to the Revolution is the boldness of<br/>
initiative.<br/>
<br/>
With <a href="our.htm">our</a> minds already narrowed in <a href="our.htm">our</a> youth and enslaved by the <a href="past.htm">past</a> in<br/>
<a href="our.htm">our</a> mature age, <a href="we.htm">we</a> hardly dare to think. If a <a href="new.htm">new</a> idea is<br/>
mentioned--before venturing on an opinion of <a href="our.htm">our</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>, <a href="we.htm">we</a> consult <a href="must.htm">must</a>y<br/>
books a hundred years <a href="old.htm">old</a>, to know what ancient masters thought on the<br/>
subject.<br/>
<br/>
It is not <a href="food.htm">food</a> that will fail, if boldness of thought and initiative are<br/>
not <a href="want.htm">want</a>ing to the revolution.<br/>
<br/>
Of all the great days of the French Revolution, the most beautiful, the<br/>
greatest, was the one on which delegates who had come from all parts of<br/>
France to Paris, <a href="work.htm">work</a>ed all with the spade to <a href="plan.htm">plan</a>e the ground of the<br/>
Champ de Mars, preparing it for the fête of the Federation.<br/>
<br/>
That day France was united: animated by the <a href="new.htm">new</a> spirit, she had a vision<br/>
of the <a href="future.htm">future</a> in the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing in <a href="common.htm">common</a> of the soil.<br/>
<br/>
And it will again be by the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing in <a href="common.htm">common</a> of the soil that the<br/>
enfranchised societies will find their unity and will obliterate the<br/>
hatred and oppression which has hitherto divided them.<br/>
<br/>
Henceforth, able to conceive solidarity--that immense power which<br/>
increases man's energy and <a href="creat.htm">creat</a>ive forces a hundredfold--the <a href="new.htm">new</a><br/>
society will march to the conquest of the <a href="future.htm">future</a> with all the vigour of<br/>
youth.<br/>
<br/>
Ceasing to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e for unknown <a href="buy.htm">buy</a>ers, and looking in its midst for<br/>
<a href="need.htm">need</a>s and tastes to be satisfied, society will liberally <a href="assur.htm">assur</a>e the life<br/>
and ease of each of its members, as well as that moral satisfaction<br/>
which <a href="work.htm">work</a> give when <a href="free.htm">free</a>ly chosen and <a href="free.htm">free</a>ly accomplished, and the joy<br/>
of living without encroaching on the life of others.<br/>
<br/>
Inspired by a <a href="new.htm">new</a> daring--born of the feeling of solidarity--all will<br/>
march together to the conquest of the high joys of knowledge and<br/>
artistic <a href="creat.htm">creat</a>ion.<br/>
<br/>
A society thus inspired will fear neither dissensions within nor enemies<br/>
without. To the coalitions of the <a href="past.htm">past</a> it will oppose a <a href="new.htm">new</a> harmony, the<br/>
initiative of each and all, the daring which springs from the awakening<br/>
of a people's genius.<br/>
<br/>
Before such an irresistible force "conspiring kings" will be powerless.<br/>
No<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> will remain for them but to bow before it, and to harness<br/>
themselves to the chariot of humanity, rolling towards <a href="new.htm">new</a> horizons<br/>
<a href="open.htm">open</a>ed up by the Social Revolution.<br/>
