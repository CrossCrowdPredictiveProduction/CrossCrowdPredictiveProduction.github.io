<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arranged by the Global Challenges Foundation<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction<br/>
<br/>
Today, mankind lives not only in national societies, but also in a global <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ity. This <a href="means.htm">means</a><br/>
that the behavior and decisions of the inhabitants of nation <a href="state.htm">state</a>s also impact the vital<br/>
<a href="interest.htm">interest</a>s of inhabitants of other countries. Global warming may be the most obvious example:<br/>
Greenhouse gas emissions in any <a href="part.htm">part</a>icular country will have an impact on global climate <a href="chang.htm">chang</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
The world <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ity is facing a number of major global challenges which have to be <a href="join.htm">join</a>tly<br/>
managed by all countries through increased co-operation and an increased understanding of <a href="our.htm">our</a><br/>
interconnectedness. Other than climate <a href="chang.htm">chang</a>e, the major problems and risks are other large-scale<br/>
environmental damage and politically motivated violence <small>(war, civil war, terrorism, weapons of<br/>
mass destruction)</small>. Other major problems faced are extreme po<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>y and rapid population <a href="grow.htm">grow</a>th.<br/>
<br/>
Rapid population <a href="grow.htm">grow</a>th – the global population has quadrupled over the last 100 years <small>(which is<br/>
one of the main reasons for the problem <a href="we.htm">we</a> face today)</small>, and is expected to increase by another 50<br/>
percent by the year 2100 – exacerbates all these problems. Despite this, and despite the<br/>
knowledge that there are not n<a href="early.htm">early</a> enough re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es on the <a href="plan.htm">plan</a>et for the entire population of<br/>
Earth to enjoy the <a href="cur.htm">cur</a><a href="rent.htm">rent</a> Western standard of living, the issue is not on the political agenda.<br/>
<br/>
In order to manage these challenges, <a href="we.htm">we</a> <a href="need.htm">need</a> effective ways of <a href="making.htm">making</a> collectively binding,<br/>
long-<a href="term.htm">term</a> decisions that take into account the <a href="interest.htm">interest</a>s of all those affected, including <a href="future.htm">future</a><br/>
generations. The system <a href="cur.htm">cur</a><a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ly in place to manage these issues – including the UN and the<br/>
<a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nizations connected with the UN – are, in their present form, not up to the task. Today,<br/>
these challenges are responded to using yesterday’s <a href="tool.htm">tool</a>s – multi<a href="late.htm">late</a>ral negotiations which are<br/>
susceptible to short-<a href="term.htm">term</a> national <a href="interest.htm">interest</a>s. As a consequence, the necessary <a href="act.htm">act</a>ion is either<br/>
not taken or is taken too <a href="late.htm">late</a>, while the problems and risks continue to <a href="grow.htm">grow</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The Global Challenges&nbsp;&nbsp;Foundation <a href="want.htm">want</a>s to challenge <a href="part.htm">part</a>icipants from all over the world to<br/>
formu<a href="late.htm">late</a> alternatives to the present <a href="state.htm">state</a> of affairs – either by complementing, strengthening<br/>
and revising the present UN system, or by proposing completely <a href="new.htm">new</a> forms of governance. The<br/>
proposals should be drafted with the aim of identifying and, as far as possible, preventing or<br/>
minimizing challenges of the kind mentioned above.<br/>
<br/>
The Task<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="part.htm">part</a>icipant <a href="must.htm">must</a> de<a href="sign.htm">sign</a> a governance <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el able to effectively address the most pressing<br/>
threats and risks to humanity. In other <a href="word.htm">word</a>s, the task is not to come up with direct <a href="solu.htm">solu</a>tions<br/>
to specific problems. Rather, it is to de<a href="sign.htm">sign</a> a general <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el for decision-<a href="making.htm">making</a>, with the aim<br/>
of generating such <a href="solu.htm">solu</a>tions and the ability to do so, and possessing the re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es to<br/>
effectively implement them.<br/>
<br/>
The governance <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el <a href="must.htm">must</a> also be such that it can be implemented within the foreseeable <a href="future.htm">future</a>.<br/>
This requires that it be acceptable to major <a href="state.htm">state</a>s and the wider international <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ity. A<br/>
<a href="sign.htm">sign</a>ificant measure of civic acceptance is also required. This requirement eliminates <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>els that<br/>
rely on <a href="time.htm">time</a>-<a href="consum.htm">consum</a>ing and controversial <a href="chang.htm">chang</a>es in the political system of individual <a href="state.htm">state</a>s,<br/>
e.g. <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>els that postu<a href="late.htm">late</a> that all <a href="state.htm">state</a>s should be democracies.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, the governance <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el <a href="must.htm">must</a> involve a minimum of limitations to the <a href="sove.htm">sove</a>reignty of<br/>
nation-<a href="state.htm">state</a>s, meaning that it should involve only such limitations as are necessary to ensure<br/>
that national decisions do not seriously harm the vital <a href="interest.htm">interest</a>s of inhabitants of other<br/>
countries, or of humanity as a whole. In other <a href="word.htm">word</a>s, decisions within the governance <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el <a href="must.htm">must</a><br/>
not deal with the internal affairs of individual <a href="state.htm">state</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
The entries <a href="must.htm">must</a> consist of the following three <a href="part.htm">part</a>s:<br/>
<br/>
1. Abstract <small>(no more than 1000 <a href="word.htm">word</a>s)</small><br/>
The abstract <a href="must.htm">must</a> summarize the de<a href="sign.htm">sign</a> of the <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el, including the <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>itutions, regulations,<br/>
decision-<a href="making.htm">making</a> paths and <a href="control.htm">control</a> mechanisms it involves, as well as how key individuals and<br/>
other decision-<a href="making.htm">making</a> bodies are to be ap<a href="point.htm">point</a>ed.<br/>
<br/>
2. Description of the <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>el <small>(no more than 5500 <a href="word.htm">word</a>s)</small><br/>
The document <a href="must.htm">must</a> be divided into subsections with clear and descriptive headings. The<br/>
<a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipant <a href="must.htm">must</a> cl<a href="early.htm">early</a> define the functions of the various components, their areas of<br/>
responsibility and the extent of their decision-<a href="making.htm">making</a> mandate. Also, describe how the <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el is<br/>
meant to manage <a href="bot.htm">bot</a>h <a href="cur.htm">cur</a><a href="rent.htm">rent</a> and emerging challenges and risks.<br/>
<br/>
3. Argumentation demonstrating how the <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el meets the assessment criteria <small>(no more than 2750<br/>
<a href="word.htm">word</a>s)</small><br/>
For each of the criteria listed below, the <a href="part.htm">part</a>icipant <a href="must.htm">must</a> provide convincing arguments as to<br/>
how the proposed <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el meets the criterion.<br/>
<br/>
Assessment criteria<br/>
<br/>
Entries will be assessed based on how well they can be expected to manage global challenges and<br/>
meet the criteria listed below:<br/>
<br/>
1. Core <a href="valu.htm">Valu</a>es.<br/>
Decisions within the governance <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el <a href="must.htm">must</a> be guided by the <a href="good.htm">good</a> of all humankind and by respect<br/>
for the equal <a href="valu.htm">valu</a>e of all human beings.<br/>
<br/>
2. Decision-<a href="making.htm">Making</a> Capa<a href="city.htm">city</a>.<br/>
Decision-<a href="making.htm">making</a> within the governance <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el <a href="must.htm">must</a> generally be possible without crippling delays<br/>
that prevent the challenges from being adequately addressed <small>(e.g. due to <a href="part.htm">part</a>ies exercising<br/>
powers of veto)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
3. Effectiveness.<br/>
The governance <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el <a href="must.htm">must</a> be capable of handling the global challenges and risks and include<br/>
<a href="means.htm">means</a> to ensure implementation of decisions. <br/>
<br/>
4. Re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es and Financing.<br/>
The governance <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el <a href="must.htm">must</a> have sufficient human and <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ial re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es at its disposal, and these<br/>
re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es <a href="must.htm">must</a> be financed in an equitable manner.<br/>
<br/>
5. <a href="trust.htm">Trust</a> and Insight.<br/>
The <a href="trust.htm">trust</a> enjoyed by a successful governance <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el and its <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>itutions relies on <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>parency<br/>
and considerable insight into power structures and decision-<a href="making.htm">making</a>.<br/>
<br/>
6. Flexibility.<br/>
In order to be able to fulfil its <a href="object.htm">object</a>ives effectively, a successful governance <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el <a href="must.htm">must</a><br/>
contain mechanisms that allow for revisions and improvements to be made to its structure and<br/>
components.<br/>
<br/>
7. <a href="protect.htm">Protect</a>ion aga<a href="inst.htm">inst</a> the Abuse of Power.<br/>
A <a href="control.htm">control</a> system <a href="must.htm">must</a> be in place to take <a href="act.htm">act</a>ion if the <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization should overstep its mandate,<br/>
e.g. by unduly interfering with the internal affairs of nation-<a href="state.htm">state</a>s or favouring the special<br/>
<a href="interest.htm">interest</a>s of individuals, <a href="group.htm">group</a>s, <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nizations, <a href="state.htm">state</a>s or <a href="group.htm">group</a>s of <a href="state.htm">state</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
8. Accountability.<br/>
It is a <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>amental requirement of a successful governance <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el that it performs the tasks it<br/>
has been <a href="charg.htm">charg</a>ed with, and the governance <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el <a href="must.htm">must</a> include the power to <a href="hold.htm">hold</a> the<br/>
decision-<a href="make.htm">make</a>rs accountable for their <a href="act.htm">act</a>ions.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="term.htm">Term</a>s &amp;amp; conditions<br/>
<br/>
When the Global Challenges Foundation chose to extend the competition deadlines, <a href="we.htm">we</a> also took the<br/>
op<a href="port.htm">port</a>unity to clarify some of the <a href="rule.htm">rule</a>s and criteria of the competition, based on questions <a href="we.htm">we</a><br/>
have received. The following are <a href="chang.htm">chang</a>es that have been made in the <a href="term.htm">Term</a>s and Conditions of the<br/>
Global Challenges Prize 2017: A <a href="new shape.htm">New Shape</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Acceptance of the <a href="term.htm">term</a>s and conditions of this <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment <small>(the "Competition <a href="term.htm">Term</a>s and Conditions")</small><br/>
is a prerequisite for <a href="part.htm">part</a>icipation in the Prize Competition <small>(as defined below)</small> arranged by the<br/>
Global Challenges Foundation, with registration number 802477-3494, and address Birger Jarlsgatan<br/>
57 C, Stockholm Sweden <small>(the "Foundation")</small>. The Foundation is a non-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a> foundation and the<br/>
Foundation does not conduct any business or have any <a href="commer.htm">commer</a>cial <a href="interest.htm">interest</a>s. For the avoidance of<br/>
doubt, the Prize Competition should not be interpreted as promoting any <a href="interest.htm">interest</a> of the<br/>
Foundation other than the <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>elopment of a global governance <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el.<br/>
<br/>
By clicking "I accept", the individual or legal entity submitting a registration to <a href="part.htm">part</a>icipate<br/>
in the Prize Competition <small>(the "<a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipant")</small> undertakes to comply with, and be bound by, the<br/>
Competition <a href="term.htm">Term</a>s and Conditions in conjunction with <a href="part.htm">part</a>icipating in the Prize Competition by<br/>
submitting a competition entry in accordance with the provisions set out herein and otherwise<br/>
<a href="commun.htm">commun</a>icated by the Foundation <small>(the "Competition Entry")</small>. The <a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipant also confirms that the<br/>
age of the <a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipant is above the age limit, as set out in applicable <a href="law.htm">law</a>, to <a href="part.htm">part</a>icipate in<br/>
the Prize Competition and that the <a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipant has read and understood the Foundation's <a href="priv.htm">Priv</a>acy<br/>
Policy.<br/>
<br/>
If the registration to <a href="part.htm">part</a>icipate is submitted on behalf of a legal entity, the individual<br/>
submitting the registration <a href="must.htm">must</a> be authorized to <a href="sign.htm">sign</a> on behalf of such legal entity.<br/>
<br/>
The Foundation and the <a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipant are also referred to below as the "<a href="part.htm">Part</a>ies" and individually<br/>
as a "<a href="part.htm">Part</a>y".<br/>
<br/>
&lt;span>Background and Introduction&lt;/span><br/>
<br/>
A. The purpose of the Foundation is to raise awareness of the greatest threats facing humanity.<br/>
In <a href="part.htm">part</a>icular, the Foundation seeks to raise awareness of climate <a href="chang.htm">chang</a>e, other environmental<br/>
damage and political violence, and how these threats are linked to po<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>y and the rapid <a href="grow.htm">grow</a>th<br/>
in the global population.<br/>
<br/>
B. In the course of its <a href="act.htm">act</a>ivities, the Foundation intends to arrange a prize competition<br/>
concerning the <a href="matt.htm">matt</a>ers as set out and described under C to E below and in accordance with the<br/>
provisions set out in these Competition <a href="term.htm">Term</a>s and Conditions <small>(the "Prize Competition")</small>.<br/>
<br/>
C. Today, mankind lives not only in national societies, but also in a global <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ity. This<br/>
<a href="means.htm">means</a> that the behaviour and decisions of the inhabitants of nation <a href="state.htm">state</a>s also impact the vital<br/>
<a href="interest.htm">interest</a>s of inhabitants of other countries. Global warming may be the most obvious example:<br/>
Greenhouse gas emissions in any <a href="part.htm">part</a>icular country will have an impact on global climate <a href="chang.htm">chang</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
D. The world <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ity is facing a number of major global challenges which have to be <a href="join.htm">join</a>tly<br/>
managed by all countries through increased co-operation and an increased understanding of <a href="our.htm">our</a><br/>
interconnectedness. Other than climate <a href="chang.htm">chang</a>e, the major problems and risks are other large-scale<br/>
environmental damage and politically motivated violence <small>(war, civil war, terrorism, weapons of<br/>
mass destruction)</small>. Other major problems faced are extreme po<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>y and rapid population <a href="grow.htm">grow</a>th.<br/>
<br/>
E. Rapid population <a href="grow.htm">grow</a>th – the global population has quadrupled over the last 100 years <small>(which<br/>
is one of the main reasons for the problem <a href="we.htm">we</a> face today)</small>, and is expected to increase by another<br/>
50 percent by the year 2100 – exacerbates all these problems. Despite this, and despite the<br/>
knowledge that there are not n<a href="early.htm">early</a> enough re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es on the <a href="plan.htm">plan</a>et for the entire population of<br/>
Earth to enjoy the <a href="cur.htm">cur</a><a href="rent.htm">rent</a> Western standard of living, the issue is not on the political agenda.<br/>
<br/>
In order to manage these challenges, <a href="we.htm">we</a> <a href="need.htm">need</a> effective ways of <a href="making.htm">making</a> collectively binding,<br/>
long-<a href="term.htm">term</a> decisions that take into account the <a href="interest.htm">interest</a>s of all those affected, including <a href="future.htm">future</a><br/>
generations. The system <a href="cur.htm">cur</a><a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ly in place to manage these issues – including the UN and the<br/>
<a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nizations connected with the UN – are, in their present form, not up to the task. Today,<br/>
these challenges are responded to using yesterday’s <a href="tool.htm">tool</a>s – multi<a href="late.htm">late</a>ral negotiations which are<br/>
susceptible to short-<a href="term.htm">term</a> national <a href="interest.htm">interest</a>s. As a consequence, the necessary <a href="act.htm">act</a>ion is either<br/>
not taken or is taken too <a href="late.htm">late</a>, while the problems and risks continue to <a href="grow.htm">grow</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The Foundation <a href="want.htm">want</a>s to challenge <a href="part.htm">part</a>icipants from all over the world to formu<a href="late.htm">late</a> alternatives<br/>
to the present <a href="state.htm">state</a> of affairs – either by complementing, strengthening and revising the present<br/>
UN system, or by proposing completely <a href="new.htm">new</a> forms of governance. The proposals should be drafted<br/>
with the aim of identifying and, as far as possible, preventing or minimizing challenges of the<br/>
kind mentioned above.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;span>1. General <a href="rule.htm">rule</a>s governing the Prize Competition&lt;/span><br/>
<br/>
a)</small> The Prize Competition is <a href="open.htm">open</a> to anyone - individuals, <a href="group.htm">group</a>s of individuals, companies,<br/>
associations, universities and other legal entities - anywhere in the world, provided the<br/>
relevant individual<small>(s)</small> is/are above the age limit, as set out in applicable <a href="law.htm">law</a>, to <a href="part.htm">part</a>icipate<br/>
in the Prize Competition and is not a Restricted <a href="person.htm">Person</a> <small>(as defined below)</small>. Every Competition<br/>
Entry requires one contact <a href="person.htm">person</a> – referred to below and in other <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ications as a<br/>
"Corresponding Author" and such <a href="person.htm">person</a> will be regarded as the <a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipant. However, if a<br/>
Competition Entry has more than one author, all authors <a href="must.htm">must</a> register and confirm their<br/>
<a href="part.htm">part</a>icipation in the Prize Competition in order to be recognized as the <a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipant<small>(s)</small> and<br/>
co-authors of the relevant Competition Entry. The Corresponding Author will be the contact <a href="person.htm">person</a><br/>
for the Competition Entry and responsible for <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ications with the Foundation. In addition,<br/>
the Corresponding Author will be considered responsible for ensuring the Competition Entry’s<br/>
compliance with these Competition <a href="term.htm">Term</a>s and Conditions. If the Corresponding Author is submitting<br/>
a Competition Entry on behalf of a legal entity, the legal entity in question will <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ead be<br/>
considered the <a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipant.<br/>
<br/>
b)</small> <a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipation is <a href="free.htm">free</a> of <a href="charg.htm">charg</a>e, and no fees or other <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s will be <a href="charg.htm">charg</a>ed to the<br/>
<a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipants.<br/>
<br/>
c)</small> A <a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipant <a href="must.htm">must</a> register his or her <a href="interest.htm">interest</a> in <a href="part.htm">part</a>icipating in the Prize Competition by<br/>
registering at &lt;nobr><a class="ext" href="https://globalchallenges.org</nobr>.">https://globalchallenges.org</nobr>.</a> Upon registration, the <a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipant will receive<br/>
further <a href="info.htm">info</a>rmation on how to submit a Competition Entry. The registration period is <a href="open.htm">open</a> from 24<br/>
November 2016 until 31 March 2017. A <a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipant may register his or her <a href="interest.htm">interest</a> in<br/>
<a href="part.htm">part</a>icipating in the Prize Competition <a href="late.htm">late</a>r than 31 March 2017, but the Foundation re<a href="serv.htm">serv</a>es the<br/>
right, in its sole discretion, to decline a registration and the <a href="part.htm">part</a>icipation by a <a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipant<br/>
registered after 31 March 2017. Such <a href="late.htm">late</a> registered <a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipant will, as soon as reasonably<br/>
possible, be <a href="info.htm">info</a>rmed by the Foundation whether he or she may still be allowed to <a href="part.htm">part</a>icipate in<br/>
the Prize Competition. For the avoidance of doubt, registration does not result in any obligation<br/>
for the <a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipant to submit a Competition Entry.<br/>
<br/>
d)</small> Competition Entries can be submitted in English, Mandarin, Spanish, Russian, Arabic, and<br/>
French. Competition Entries in any other <a href="lang.htm">lang</a>uage will not be accepted.<br/>
<br/>
e)</small> Multiple Competition Entries from the same <a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipant are acceptable as long as they all<br/>
address the format of the Competition Entries as set out in section 2 below.<br/>
<br/>
f)</small> <a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipants can submit Competition Entries from 1 April 2017 until 30 September 2017. No<br/>
Competition Entries will be accepted after 30 September 2017. <br/>
<br/>
g)</small> The Competition Entries will be reviewed and assessed in accordance with section 3 below.<br/>
<br/>
h)</small> The final results of the Prize Competition are expected to be announced in April 2018.<br/>
<br/>
i)</small> The Foundation will not accept any Competition Entries from <a href="part.htm">part</a>icipants that <small>(as of 21 June<br/>
2016 onwards)</small> are connected to the Foundation, such as <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ees, board members, agents or other<br/>
contracted consultants or any family member of any such <a href="person.htm">person</a>s <small>("Restricted <a href="person.htm">Person</a>s")</small>. The<br/>
Foundation will not accept any Competition Entries of any such Restricted <a href="person.htm">Person</a> and re<a href="serv.htm">serv</a>es all<br/>
rights to disqualify any Competition Entry submitted by a Restricted <a href="person.htm">Person</a>.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;span>2. Content and Format of Competition Entries&lt;/span><br/>
<br/>
&lt;span>2.1 The Task&lt;/span><br/>
<br/>
The <a href="part.htm">part</a>icipant <a href="must.htm">must</a> de<a href="sign.htm">sign</a> a governance <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el able to effectively address the most pressing<br/>
threats and risks to humanity. In other <a href="word.htm">word</a>s, the task is not to come up with direct <a href="solu.htm">solu</a>tions<br/>
to specific problems. Rather, it is to de<a href="sign.htm">sign</a> a general <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el for decision-<a href="making.htm">making</a>, with the aim<br/>
of generating such <a href="solu.htm">solu</a>tions and the ability to do so, and possessing the re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es to<br/>
effectively implement them.<br/>
<br/>
The governance <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el <a href="must.htm">must</a> also be such that it can be implemented within the foreseeable <a href="future.htm">future</a>.<br/>
This requires that it be acceptable to major <a href="state.htm">state</a>s and the wider international <a href="commun.htm">commun</a>ity. A<br/>
<a href="sign.htm">sign</a>ificant measure of civic acceptance is also required. This requirement eliminates <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>els that<br/>
rely on <a href="time.htm">time</a>-<a href="consum.htm">consum</a>ing and controversial <a href="chang.htm">chang</a>es in the political system of individual <a href="state.htm">state</a>s,<br/>
e.g. <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>els that postu<a href="late.htm">late</a> that all <a href="state.htm">state</a>s should be democracies.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, the governance <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el <a href="must.htm">must</a> involve a minimum of limitations to the <a href="sove.htm">sove</a>reignty of<br/>
nation-<a href="state.htm">state</a>s, meaning that it should involve only such limitations as are necessary to ensure<br/>
that national decisions do not seriously harm the vital <a href="interest.htm">interest</a>s of inhabitants of other<br/>
countries, or of humanity as a whole. In other <a href="word.htm">word</a>s, decisions within the governance <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el <a href="must.htm">must</a><br/>
not deal with the internal affairs of individual <a href="state.htm">state</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
The contributions <a href="must.htm">must</a> consist of the following three <a href="part.htm">part</a>s:<br/>
<br/>
a)</small> Abstract <small>(no more than 1000 <a href="word.htm">word</a>s)</small><br/>
<br/>
The abstract <a href="must.htm">must</a> summarize the de<a href="sign.htm">sign</a> of the <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el, including the <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>itutions, regulations,<br/>
decision-<a href="making.htm">making</a> paths and <a href="control.htm">control</a> mechanisms it involves, as well as how key individuals and<br/>
other decision-<a href="making.htm">making</a> bodies are to be ap<a href="point.htm">point</a>ed.<br/>
<br/>
b)</small> Description of the <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>el <small>(no more than 5500 <a href="word.htm">word</a>s)</small><br/>
<br/>
The document <a href="must.htm">must</a> be divided into subsections with clear and descriptive headings. The<br/>
<a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipant <a href="must.htm">must</a> cl<a href="early.htm">early</a> define the functions of the various components, their areas of<br/>
responsibility and the extent of their decision-<a href="making.htm">making</a> mandate. Also, describe how the <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el is<br/>
meant to manage <a href="bot.htm">bot</a>h <a href="cur.htm">cur</a><a href="rent.htm">rent</a> and emerging challenges and risks.<br/>
<br/>
c)</small> Argumentation demonstrating how the <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el meets the assessment criteria <small>(no more than 2750<br/>
<a href="word.htm">word</a>s)</small><br/>
<br/>
For each of the criteria listed in section 2.2 below, the <a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipant <a href="must.htm">must</a> provide convincing<br/>
arguments as to how the proposed <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el meets the criterion.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, <a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipants are <a href="perm.htm">perm</a>itted <small>(but not required)</small> to submit a maximum of two<br/>
supplementary non-<a href="text.htm">text</a> items such as graphs, figures, images or short film clips that assist in<br/>
the understanding of the <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el presented in the <a href="text.htm">text</a> <small>("Supplementary <a href="mater.htm">Mater</a>ial")</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The<br/>
Supplementary <a href="mater.htm">Mater</a>ial may not contain extensive <a href="text.htm">text</a> elements and may not add <a href="new.htm">new</a> elements to<br/>
the <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el that were not explained in the <a href="text.htm">text</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The Supplementary <a href="mater.htm">Mater</a>ial may be submitted in the form of attached files <small>(PDF or JPEG)</small> or links<br/>
to <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ial. Each attached file may contain one page only, and any film or sound clips may not<br/>
exceed three minutes. For the avoidance of doubt, any Supplementary <a href="mater.htm">Mater</a>ial <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>eloped by a third<br/>
<a href="part.htm">part</a>y author, i.e. not the <a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipant, requires the consent of the relevant third <a href="part.htm">part</a>y author.<br/>
<br/>
It is very im<a href="port.htm">port</a>ant that any Supplementary <a href="mater.htm">Mater</a>ial – as well as <a href="text.htm">text</a>s in a)</small> to c)</small> – does not<br/>
identify the author in any way. Submissions will be anonymised before assessment, and any form of<br/>
identifier other than the <a href="info.htm">info</a>rmation supplied in the author profile, may result in the<br/>
disqualification of the submission.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;span>2.2 Assessment criteria&lt;/span><br/>
<br/>
Entries will be assessed based on how well they can be expected to manage global challenges and<br/>
meet the criteria listed below:<br/>
<br/>
a)</small> Core <a href="valu.htm">Valu</a>es<br/>
<br/>
Decisions within the governance <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el <a href="must.htm">must</a> be guided by the <a href="good.htm">good</a> of all humankind and by respect<br/>
for the equal <a href="valu.htm">valu</a>e of all human beings.<br/>
<br/>
b)</small> Decision-<a href="making.htm">Making</a> Capa<a href="city.htm">city</a><br/>
<br/>
Decision-<a href="making.htm">making</a> within the governance <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el <a href="must.htm">must</a> generally be possible without crippling delays<br/>
that prevent the challenges from being adequately addressed <small>(e.g. due to <a href="part.htm">part</a>ies exercising<br/>
powers of veto)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
c)</small> Effectiveness<br/>
<br/>
The governance <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el <a href="must.htm">must</a> be capable of handling the global challenges and risks and include<br/>
<a href="means.htm">means</a> to ensure implementation of decisions.<br/>
<br/>
d)</small> Re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es and Financing<br/>
<br/>
The governance <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el <a href="must.htm">must</a> have sufficient human and <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ial re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es at its disposal, and these<br/>
re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es <a href="must.htm">must</a> be financed in an equitable manner.<br/>
<br/>
e)</small> <a href="trust.htm">Trust</a> and Insight<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="trust.htm">trust</a> enjoyed by a successful governance <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el and its <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>itutions relies on <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>parency<br/>
and considerable insight into power structures and decision-<a href="making.htm">making</a>.<br/>
<br/>
f)</small> Flexibility<br/>
<br/>
In order to be able to fulfil its <a href="object.htm">object</a>ives effectively, a successful governance <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el <a href="must.htm">must</a><br/>
contain mechanisms that allow for revisions and improvements to be made to its structure and<br/>
components.<br/>
<br/>
g)</small> <a href="protect.htm">Protect</a>ion aga<a href="inst.htm">inst</a> the Abuse of Power<br/>
<br/>
A <a href="control.htm">control</a> system <a href="must.htm">must</a> be in place to take <a href="act.htm">act</a>ion if the <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization oversteps its mandate, e.g.<br/>
by unduly interfering with the internal affairs of nation <a href="state.htm">state</a>s or favouring the special<br/>
<a href="interest.htm">interest</a>s of individuals, <a href="group.htm">group</a>s, <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nizations, <a href="state.htm">state</a>s or <a href="group.htm">group</a>s of <a href="state.htm">state</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
h)</small> Accountability<br/>
<br/>
It is a <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>amental requirement of a successful governance <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el that it perform the tasks it has<br/>
been <a href="charg.htm">charg</a>ed with, and the governance <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el <a href="must.htm">must</a> include the power to <a href="hold.htm">hold</a> the decision-<a href="make.htm">make</a>rs<br/>
accountable for their <a href="act.htm">act</a>ions.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;span>3. Assessment&lt;/span><br/>
<br/>
a)</small> The Foundation will conduct an initial review of the Competition Entries to ensure that the<br/>
Competition Entries fulfil and comply with the format of the Competition Entries as set out in<br/>
section 2 above.<br/>
<br/>
b)</small> All eligible and complete Competition Entries that comply with the format of the Competition<br/>
Entries as set out in section 2 above will be assessed by Review Panels <small>(as defined below)</small>. Based<br/>
on the assessment criteria <a href="state.htm">state</a>d above, each Review Panel will select a number of Competition<br/>
Entries that will be assessed by an Expert Panel <small>(as defined below)</small>. The Expert Panel will<br/>
<a href="dev.htm">dev</a>elop a list of the best Competition Entries to be presented to the Jury <small>(as defined below)</small>.<br/>
The list may also include Competition Entries that present unique <a href="solu.htm">solu</a>tions to certain<br/>
sub-problems or include <a href="good.htm">good</a> ideas on how to implement the <a href="new.htm">new</a> governance <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el.<br/>
<br/>
c)</small> Competition Entries will be assessed on the basis of how well they can be expected to fulfil<br/>
the criteria listed in section 2.2 above. In some cases, ensuring that certain goals are met may<br/>
<a href="make.htm">make</a> it harder to realize other goals. In such cases, <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e-offs <a href="must.htm">must</a> be made. How well<br/>
<a href="part.htm">part</a>icipants manage such <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e-offs will be an im<a href="port.htm">port</a>ant <a href="factor.htm">factor</a> in the assessment. <a href="good.htm">Good</a> ideas on<br/>
how to establish the governance <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el in reality will also be considered in the assessment.<br/>
<br/>
d)</small> The Expert Panel will present the list of Competition Entries to the Jury. The Jury will<br/>
review the listed Competition Entries and each Jury member will select Competition Entries that<br/>
have qualified for a final judging day to take place in Stockholm in April 2018 <small>(the "Judging<br/>
Day")</small>.<br/>
<br/>
e)</small> The <a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipants of the qualified Competition Entries will be notified and invited to the<br/>
Judging Day. The <a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipants will be asked to present their Competition Entry before the Jury on<br/>
the Judging Day.<br/>
<br/>
f)</small> After the Judging Day, the Jury will e<a href="valu.htm">valu</a>ate the final Competition Entries and decide on the<br/>
<a href="win.htm">win</a>ning Competition Entry/Entries and, if any, other Competition Entries to be awarded.<br/>
<br/>
g)</small> The decisions of the Review Panels, the Expert Panel and the Jury are final and may not be<br/>
appealed. <br/>
<br/>
h)</small> No questions regarding how a <a href="part.htm">part</a>icular Competition Entry has been assessed will be answered<br/>
by the Foundation and no other feedback will be given on a submitted Competition Entry.<br/>
<br/>
i)</small> The Review Panels will be ap<a href="point.htm">point</a>ed by the Foundation and will consist of academics and<br/>
practitioners with expertise in relevant fields <small>(the "Review Panels")</small>. There will be at least one<br/>
panel for each of the six <a href="lang.htm">lang</a>uages that Competition Entries may be submitted in. Review Panels<br/>
will be regionally based, with at least one panel each for Western Europe, Eastern Europe<br/>
including Russia, Africa, South East Asia and China, South Asia, North America, South America and<br/>
the Middle East.<br/>
<br/>
k)</small> The jury will be a high-level international jury of respected global thought leaders <small>(the<br/>
"Jury")</small>. The Jury will be announced on the Foundation's website no <a href="late.htm">late</a>r than June 30, 2017.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;span>4. Prize <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y&lt;/span><br/>
<br/>
a)</small> The total prize <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y that may be <a href="paid.htm">paid</a> out in the Prize Competition, in the sole discretion of<br/>
the Foundation, is five million U.S. dollars <small>(USD 5,000,000)</small>. <br/>
<br/>
b)</small> Should the Jury decide to award a Competition Entry first prize, such Competition Entry will<br/>
be awarded at least one million U.S. dollars <small>(USD 1,000,000)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
c)</small> The prize <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y, five million U.S. dollars <small>(USD 5,000,000)</small>, reduced by the amount awarded to<br/>
the <a href="win.htm">win</a>ning Competition Entry <small>(if any)</small>, may be allocated to other <a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipants and may be divided<br/>
in any number of equal or non-equal <a href="port.htm">port</a>ions, all according to the <a href="valu.htm">valu</a>e placed on the<br/>
Competition Entries as de<a href="term.htm">term</a>ined by the Jury in its sole discretion for the purpose of the Prize<br/>
Competition. For the avoidance of doubt, the Jury may decide to award a <a href="port.htm">port</a>ion of the remaining<br/>
prize <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y to a Competition Entry that does not fulfil all of the formal criteria set out in<br/>
section 2 above.<br/>
<br/>
d)</small> Below are some examples of how the Jury may decide to divide the prize <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y among<br/>
<a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipants.<br/>
<br/>
Example 1:<br/>
<br/>
- The <a href="win.htm">win</a>ning <a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipant: USD 3 million <small>(USD 1 million for <a href="win.htm">win</a>ning first prize + USD 2 million<br/>
of the remaining prize <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y)</small><br/>
<br/>
- The s<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>d-place <a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipant: USD 1 million <br/>
<br/>
- Other <a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipant whose contribution did not fulfil all criteria to <a href="win.htm">win</a> but ne<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>heless<br/>
impressed the Jury: USD 1 million <br/>
<br/>
Example 2:<br/>
<br/>
- The <a href="win.htm">win</a>ning <a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipant: USD 5 million <small>(USD 1 million for <a href="win.htm">win</a>ning first prize + USD 4 million<br/>
of the remaining prize <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y)</small><br/>
<br/>
Example 3:<br/>
<br/>
- The <a href="win.htm">win</a>ning <a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipant: USD 3 million <small>(USD 1 million for <a href="win.htm">win</a>ning first prize + USD 2 million<br/>
of the remaining prize <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y)</small><br/>
<br/>
- The s<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>d-place <a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipant: USD 1 million<br/>
<br/>
- The third-place <a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipant: USD 500 000<br/>
<br/>
- The fourth-place <a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipant: USD 200 000<br/>
<br/>
- Other <a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipant whose contribution did not fulfil all criteria to <a href="win.htm">win</a> but which ne<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>heless<br/>
impressed the Jury: USD 300 000 <br/>
<br/>
e)</small> Any prize <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y awarded to a Competition Entry will be divided equally between all<br/>
<a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipants that have been registered and confirmed as authors of the relevant Competition<br/>
Entry, unless the Foundation receives confirmation from all authors of the Competition Entry that<br/>
a diffe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> division of the prize <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y has been <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>d upon. If the Competition Entry is<br/>
submitted on behalf of a legal entity, the prize <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y will be <a href="paid.htm">paid</a> to that entity.<br/>
<br/>
f)</small> The <a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipants that have submitted <a href="win.htm">win</a>ning Competition Entries will be notified individually<br/>
by post, telephone or e-mail. Other <a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipants will not receive any notification of the results<br/>
of the Prize Competition other than the <a href="info.htm">info</a>rmation provided on the Foundation's website. <br/>
<br/>
g)</small> The Foundation re<a href="serv.htm">serv</a>es all rights to conduct searches and perform due diligence in accordance<br/>
with applicable legislation on any <a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipants that may be awarded any prize <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y.<br/>
<br/>
h)</small> For the avoidance of doubt, the Foundation is under no obligation to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> any prize <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y to<br/>
any individual <a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipant, and no individual <a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipant is entitled to receive any <a href="sort.htm">sort</a> of<br/>
compensation, financial or other, in connection with the Prize Competition other than prize <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y<br/>
<small>(if any)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
i)</small> This prize <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y constitutes the total amount that will be <a href="paid.htm">paid</a> for the <a href="win.htm">win</a>ning Competition<br/>
Entries and covers all <a href="tax.htm">tax</a>es, social <a href="secur.htm">secur</a>ity <a href="charg.htm">charg</a>es and other fees and <a href="charg.htm">charg</a>es of any kind<br/>
whatsoever <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>able by <a href="bot.htm">bot</a>h the Foundation and the <a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipant, including VAT and <a href="sim.htm">sim</a>ilar <a href="tax.htm">tax</a>es<br/>
