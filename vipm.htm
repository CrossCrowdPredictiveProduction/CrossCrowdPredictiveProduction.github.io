<br/>
A Vertically Integrated Permaculture Mosaic <small>(<a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>)</small> is a cohesive frame<a href="work.htm">work</a> of all the <a href="source.htm">source</a>s required to continuously re<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e all the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts we need, bound by the constraints of the <a href="iota.htm">IOTA</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The minimum size and complexity of a <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> is bound by the desired quality-of-life and by the completeness of vertical integration.<br/>
<br/>
The initial boot-up phase of may require <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers live in tents and eat cafeteria-style meals that they prepare from bulk purchases until they have built the first of the permanent structures and before the agriculture is fully operational.<br/>
<br/>
We will grow most of the inputs for food, soap, cloth, medicine, and building materials on site, but the "lead time" could be years for some <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means some of the investment <a href="money.htm">money</a> must be used to purchase these raw ingredients in bulk so the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers have basic food and shelter and first-aid as we <a href="work.htm">work</a> toward full vertical integration.<br/>
<br/>
We will create 'core' businesses that are each co-owned by the future customers of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, a chicken farm and tools for those who want eggs, a dental office and tools for those who want to insure their teeth will be fixed, a barley field and hops field and a brewery and tools for those who want beer, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;We can most likely use <a href="crowd.htm">crowd</a>-funding to start for each of these with the 'perk' being real co-ownership in that enterprise.<br/>
<br/>
A variety of these core businesses to cover each need we have will allow us to exchange <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s and thereby also eliminate the payment of wages in the traditional sense.<br/>
<br/>
Each co-owner of the <a href="source.htm">source</a>s <small>(such chickens, dental-tools, brewery)</small> owns the same portion of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts <small>(eggs or fixed teeth or beer)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
This creates a solid foundation for the efficiency of scale needed to compete with traditional business.&nbsp;&nbsp;Selling <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>s will be rare for real needs since it is impossible to get the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t for less than the real costs of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
Once each core is full operational, we begin selling <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a> to outsiders and charging <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> against them.&nbsp;&nbsp;This will cause the core to grow in size.<br/>
<br/>
To insure the cores remain stable as they scale, we will treat some % of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as an investment from the payer so that all <a href="consume.htm">consume</a>rs incrementally gain the co-ownership in the <a href="source.htm">source</a>s used to guarantee each <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t they need at the real costs of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Bootup</span><br/>
Estimate the quantity and quality food, housing, sanitation, clothing, basic health-care, child care, transportation, etc. needed to support on-site <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
Estimate the <a href="property.htm">property</a> and <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s needed for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and issue <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>s toward those goals.<br/>
<br/>
Sell those <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>s for commitments of <a href="property.htm">property</a> and <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
Part of the <a href="property.htm">property</a> must be the physical <a href="source.htm">source</a>s such as land, tools, organisms, lumber, wire, pipe, etc. needed to create and operate the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The another part of the <a href="property.htm">property</a> must be 'bootup' goods such as tents, bulk-food, used clothing, first-aid kits, etc. needed to support <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers until the agriculture is <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive and before the permanent shelters are complete.<br/>
<br/>
Depending upon the initial scale of the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>, we may also need to sell some <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>s to secure commitments of external services that are not yet available on-site.<br/>
<br/>
Potential <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers look at the list of <a href="work.htm">work</a> needed and signup to fulfill the '<a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s' portion of some <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>s for which they have skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a group of owners accept those <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s, the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er is 'paid' by that group with <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>s capable of generating one of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts he needs and, initially, by also receiving a portion of the bootup goods and external services needed until we are fully bootstrapped.<br/>
<br/>
Once we have purchased the <a href="property.htm">property</a> and secured the <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s, we can begin installing the agriculture and building the first of the shared structures.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Outline</span><br/>
Potential <a href="user.htm">user</a>s pre-pay to purchase land, water-rights, tools, plants, animals, etc. required to create basic goods and services they need such as food, shelter, cloth, soap, medicine, sanitation, basic health care including dentistry, optometry, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Some pre-pay with <a href="money.htm">money</a> used to buy the <a href="source.htm">source</a>s while others pre-pay with <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s to complete the <a href="work.htm">work</a> needed for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
After some a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of time, or after some series of events the <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>s should vest more fully to the payer to allow for selling and/or renting of that <a href="source.htm">source</a>s or the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts of those <a href="source.htm">source</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
At some point, and under certain constraints, and mostly to resolve disputes, subgroups must finally be allowed to fork from the rest while retaining <a href="source.htm">Source</a> ownership.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Commentary</span><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Incorporating for <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t - Investing for Goods<br/>
<br/>
Let's make new corporations owned by the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s of those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts.<br/>
<br/>
We will organize groups to co-buy the <a href="property.htm">property</a> needed for <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
We will organize <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers to <a href="promise.htm">promise</a> to <a href="work.htm">work</a> in the future in exchange for ownership in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Each investor <small>(whether of <a href="property.htm">property</a> or of <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s)</small> becomes a real co-owner in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> and receives the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t itself as a natural return for those investments.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each co-owner of the <a href="source.htm">source</a>s is co-owner of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts in that same a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you own .15% of a dairy, then you own .15% of the milk.<br/>
<br/>
That leaves <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> to be treated as payer investment in more <a href="source.htm">source</a>s - to become the real <a href="property.htm">property</a> of that <a href="consume.htm">consume</a>r - causing him to incrementally gain the ownership in <a href="property.htm">property</a> that will allow him to finally stop buying that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t late, but instead pay the costs early and then own the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t as a side-effect of his <a href="property.htm">property</a> ownership.<br/>
<br/>
This also&nbsp;&nbsp;auto-distributes ownership to those who pay for that growth.<br/>
<br/>
In this way we treat <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as misallocated <a href="property.htm">property</a> that must be 'reflected' back to the payer as ownership in <a href="source.htm">source</a>s <small>(and cannot be just a payout of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t or a break on the <a href="price.htm">price</a>)</small> to complete a negative-feedback loop.<br/>
<br/>
Capitalism has achieved much for humanity, but as any business scales in size it becomes clear the goals of that body conflicts with the goals of those it claims to serve.<br/>
<br/>
As society becomes more aware of these troubles, corporations try to hide their goal of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> because we understand Scarcity keeps <a href="price.htm">Price</a> above cost, and therefore striving to perpetuate <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is the very basis of the conflict between <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion and Consumption.<br/>
<br/>
It may seem there could be no solution since those who traditionally Fund <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion demand <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as a Return for the Risk they take.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are operating under the paradigm of "Exchange Value" which requires some a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of scarcity to keep <a href="price.htm">Price</a> above Cost.<br/>
<br/>
Let's re-examine our assumptions about who should Fund and therefore Own the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
Let's look at the most trivial case of a single person owning a fruit tree for his own benefit.<br/>
<br/>
He must pay all the Costs of ownership, including Wages if he does not do the <a href="work.htm">work</a> himself.<br/>
<br/>
But he cannot pay *more* than Cost, for who would he pay it to?<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is defined as <a href="price.htm">Price</a> above Cost but if he does not sell the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t, <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is undefined.<br/>
<br/>
This is all very obvious and might seem unimportant, but let's push the idea a bit further and see what happens:<br/>
<br/>
Imagine now, instead of a single Funder-Owner-<a href="user.htm">User</a>, we have thousands of such investors pooling Funds toward an orchard.<br/>
<br/>
By attracting potential <a href="user.htm">User</a>s to pre-pay for the goods they predict they will need, we can use those Funds to buy the means necessary for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="user.htm">User</a>s and Owners will then be the very same set.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t will not be sold because the ROI for the Risk is <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t itself which they attain at Cost.<br/>
<br/>
This solves the 'static' case where the number of <a href="user.htm">User</a>s matches exactly the output of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
But many of these consuming investors will want to over-own by some percentage to guarantee they have enough <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t at the round of each <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
We must do something with that <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a> or it will rot.<br/>
<br/>
We can sell those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts for <a href="price.htm">Price</a> above Cost - as much as the market will bear - but to keep the organization owned by the <a href="user.htm">User</a>s of those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts, we must treat the payment of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as an investment from the <a href="user.htm">User</a> who paid it so they also gain ownership in the <a href="property.htm">Property</a> needed for <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==<a href="ccpp.htm">CCPP</a></span><br/>
Imagine a <a href="crowd.htm">crowd</a>-funded corporation where the only shareholders were the very <a href="consume.htm">consume</a>rs of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t.<br/>
<br/>
Their ROI for taking risk would be to avoid paying <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> - since the owner of an Apple tree does not *buy* the Apples from himself, but owns those Objectives already, as a side-effect of his <a href="property.htm">property</a> ownership.<br/>
<br/>
There is no longer be "Vendor/Customer" relations to worry about since the vendor and customer would be one and the same!<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is not be sold back to each owner because it is their <a href="property.htm">property</a> already, according to the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> they invested.<br/>
<br/>
The owner of a milk cow does not buy the milk from himself since he owns it already as a result of his owning the cow.<br/>
<br/>
A cooperative sells the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t back to the supposed owners - thereby collecting !<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>! and coming under the scrutiny of government restrictions <small>(for example it is illegal to sell raw milk in some part of the US)</small> and concentrating ownership and control into the hands of a few originators and/or a council.<br/>
<br/>
If you invest more than you can use directly, you can sell that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t to others under the strict condition <small>(enforced by the <a href="iota.htm">IOTA</a>)</small> that any <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> collected during that sale be treated as an investment from that payer - so the organization can grow in size while avoiding the troubles of centralization and overaccumulation that plague nearly every other endeavor that begins to scale.<br/>
<br/>
There is no reason to worry about the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers - for that is who we are protecting, but we are protecting their ability to <a href="consume.htm">consume</a> instead of trying to prop-up wages and avoid automation.<br/>
<br/>
Wishing the machines would just stop <small>(as John Henry)</small> will become less and less of an option as the robots are coming to take the <a href="work.htm">work</a> away - and we can be *happy* about that if we are <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing on the right side of the equation!<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, even without robots, wages and <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> will approach zero as the <a href="source.htm">source</a>s become cheaper, since there will be no way to stop willing <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers from accessing those tools and thereby providing the solutions <a href="consume.htm">consume</a>rs seek.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers can invest more than they are able to <a href="consume.htm">consume</a>, but it won't do them any good when the <a href="consume.htm">consume</a>rs already have sufficient ownership needed to protect themselves from <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers who try to stop other peers from doing that <a href="work.htm">work</a> by blocking access to <a href="property.htm">property</a> needed for <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers cannot inflate wages through ownership if other <a href="consume.htm">consume</a>rs already have sufficient ownership because propping wages requires the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er be able to stop other potential <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers from accessing the <a href="property.htm">property</a>, and why would a group stop a peer from bidding to do a job especially since in some cases they might even do that <a href="work.htm">work</a> for <a href="free.htm">free</a> <small>(gratis)</small> because they see it as play.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers who invest and co-own more of the Avocado orchard than they are able to <a href="consume.htm">consume</a> will not be able to prop-up wages because the other co-owners will always have the option to do the <a href="work.htm">work</a> for themselves or to hire the lowest bidder.<br/>
<br/>
When those <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers have sufficient ownership in the <a href="source.htm">source</a>s for which they need the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts, they will not be buying <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts from anyone, but will own them already, as a side-effect of their owning the <a href="source.htm">source</a>s needed for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
You may be tempted to dismiss this as simply a <a href="consume.htm">Consume</a>r Cooperative, but this is absolutely NOT a <a href="consume.htm">Consume</a>r Cooperative.<br/>
<br/>
1.)</small> <a href="consume.htm">Consume</a>r Cooperatives *sell* the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t back to the co-owners and collect a <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> during that transaction that a committee then doles out in a Tyranny of the Majority fashion.<br/>
<br/>
1a.)</small> <a href="ccpp.htm">CCPP</a> only sells <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t to non-owners, and only when there is <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a>, and treats that <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as an investment from that payer - causing ownership and control to be automatically distributed at the point of sale back to the actor who was willing to pay for it. This system minimizes and nearly eliminates the trading of goods since the <a href="property.htm">Property</a> owner of does not buy the Objective, but owns it already as a result of his <a href="property.htm">Property</a> ownership.&nbsp;&nbsp;The trading of goods will tend toward zero but does not reach stasis because of newcomers into the system <small>(even just babies being born)</small>, and because people's interests change across time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> <a href="consume.htm">Consume</a>r Cooperatives are "Democratically Controlled" with one-member/one-vote.<br/>
<br/>
2a.)</small> <a href="ccpp.htm">CCPP</a> is far more autarchic - where any member can 'fork' his portion of the <a href="property.htm">Property</a> and secede from the union or sell those shares if a split is attempted that is finer than reasonable divisibility <small>(you can't both feed a single milk-cow grain and NOT feed that cow grain, but can divide a herd)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
2b.)</small> Each member has exactly as much vote power as he has ownership. If you own 11% of a roto-tiller and your neighbor owns 22%, then you have only half as much vote power in decisions such as "how often should we change the oil".<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3.)</small> Every <a href="consume.htm">Consume</a>r Cooperative I know of is only concerned with buying <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts that were made by Capitalists.<br/>
<br/>
3a.)</small> <a href="ccpp.htm">CCPP</a> is primarily about ownership and control of the entire tree of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion - recursively, and <a href="work.htm">work</a>s toward a Vertically Integrated Commons where we, the people, own the farms and factories and land and water rights and all the other <a href="property.htm">Property</a> and supporting <a href="property.htm">Property</a> required to re<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e those things.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Customers *already* pay all the Costs of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion. We, the <a href="consume.htm">consume</a>rs, foot the entire bill. And we *also* pay <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> because we choose to pay late.<br/>
<br/>
But if we could organize to pay early - to collectively purchase the <a href="property.htm">Property</a> needed to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts we need - then, we would still need to pay all costs.<br/>
<br/>
But since we would own the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts as a side-effect of our owning the <a href="source.htm">source</a>s, we would not be 'buying' from ourselves, and so COULD NOT pay <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>, for that final transaction would not even occur!<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is *undefined* when the <a href="consume.htm">consume</a>rs own the <a href="source.htm">source</a>s and accept the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t as ROI.<br/>
<br/>
Treating <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as the payer's investment allows us to safely include others while avoiding the typical problems of overaccumulation and excessive concentration of control that cause even the most well-intentioned organizations to finally fail to meet the needs of those they were initially formed to serve.<br/>
<br/>
These owners do not buy the finished <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts, but own them already - even before they are completed - as a side-effect of their <a href="source.htm">source</a> ownership.<br/>
<br/>
1.)</small> Since the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is not sold, <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> does not exist.<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> Since the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is not sold, there is no chance for the government to collect sales tax.<br/>
<br/>
3.)</small> Since the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is not sold, there is no chance for the government to disallow that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion <small>(buying raw milk is illegal in many parts of the US)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Another Outline</span><br/>
Attract middle-income <a href="consume.htm">Consume</a>rs to pre-pay for organic <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts and earth-friendly services.<br/>
<br/>
Hybrid Option: Attract traditional Venture Capitalists, and pay them a % of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> gathered during growth.<br/>
<br/>
Hybrid Option: Attract corporations like Pepsi, Nike, etc. who fund <a href="projects.htm">projects</a> for Public Relations purposes.<br/>
<br/>
Use part of the funds to buy cheap agricultural land without mortgage.<br/>
<br/>
Use part of the funds to buy tools, plants, animals, water rights.<br/>
<br/>
Use part of the funds to buy 'startup' needs of <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers such as tents, bulk food, used clothing, first-aid materials, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Attract <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers to build and operate the infrastructure by providing a "Basic Outcome" that covers all of: housing, all utilities <small>(electricity, gas, sewer, recycling)</small>, transportation, and even food, water, medicine, clothing, comprehensive health care, child-care, education, - eventually all the things the corporations and governments currently control instead of smaller groups.<br/>
<br/>
Occupy that land with tents to begin planting and building.<br/>
Will want to qualify as non-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a> to avoid <a href="property.htm">Property</a> taxes.<br/>
<br/>
Each Investor <small>(whether committing <a href="money.htm">money</a> or <a href="work.htm">work</a>)</small> becomes a co-owner of some <a href="property.htm">Property</a> within the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Each <a href="work.htm">work</a>er receives the 'level' of Basic Outcome according to the quantity and quality of <a href="work.htm">work</a> they commit to achieve in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Others commit their future labor in return for accepting your commitments.<br/>
<br/>
If you want the studio apartment, a 5 minute shower, and very simple meals, you will not need to commit very much of your future labor.<br/>
<br/>
If you want a 5-bedroom house want to shares in the clubhouse and more difficult meals, you will need to commit more of your future labor in order to compensate others for the extra <a href="work.htm">work</a> and land and tools<br/>
<br/>
We do not pay wages, but that is ok since the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er does not need to buy most of the goods and services he needs.<br/>
<br/>
We do not sell the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts <small>(except <a href="surplus.htm">Surplus</a>)</small> because all of that output is in the correct hands even before it is <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Overview</span><br/>
Investors become co-Owners in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> according to the value they commit as measured by the others in that subgroup.<br/>
<br/>
Each co-owner of <a href="source.htm">source</a>s is the co-owner of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts even before <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion is complete.&nbsp;&nbsp;You might say they each own their portion of all *potential* <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts.&nbsp;&nbsp;They do not buy the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts from the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>, but must only claim that which is already their <a href="property.htm">property</a>.<br/>
<br/>
For example, if you like milk and honey, then you will need co-ownership in cattle and bees and all other <a href="source.htm">source</a>ss, <small>(land, shelter, food, medicine)</small>, and the things needed to create those things <small>(plants, animals, tools)</small>, recursively through the entire tree of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Timeline</span><br/>
The vision of future <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is proposed.<br/>
We must estimate the scale and level of vertical integration needed for that, balancing more immediate needs with longer term goals.<br/>
Then we write a 'recipe' for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion which includes<br/>
&nbsp;A list of <a href="property.htm">Property</a> needed<br/>
&nbsp;A list of <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s needed<br/>
We issue <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>s against those <a href="property.htm">Property</a> and <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s.<br/>
We sell the <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>s to purchase the <a href="property.htm">Property</a>.<br/>
Some will pay with commitments of <a href="property.htm">Property</a>, usually by commitments plain-old-<a href="money.htm">money</a>.<br/>
Some will pay with commitments of <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s by committing to <a href="work.htm">work</a> in the future.<br/>
Once we have all the needed <a href="property.htm">Property</a> and <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s, we can begin <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
After the first round of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts are distributed to each investor based on their % of ownership.<br/>
Owners with <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t have the option to sell to non-owners to cover the costs of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> will be collected from the non-owners <small>(as much as the market will bear)</small>, and is treated as they payer's investment toward more <a href="property.htm">Property</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers commit <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s, they receive ownership in the <a href="property.htm">Property</a> of that which they needs the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts, not necessarily in that which they know how to operate or maintain.<br/>
<br/>
So, if you want "Dental Assurance", you need co-ownership in the land and capital needed to perform dentistry, and then you 'hire' any Dentist to fix your teeth by cross-committing <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s to <a href="work.htm">work</a> on behalf of that dentist in return for his <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a> to fix your teeth when needed.<br/>

<br/>
Promising to <a href="work.htm">work</a> *before* <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion begins allows us to trade Labor between ourselves and never need to trade oranges with apples, since the co-owners of the <a href="property.htm">Property</a> own their % of the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t *already*, even before they are <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is "Predictive Barter" - where we <a href="property.htm">Property</a> and <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s are preallocated to those who need the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A functional <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> will require a minimum "Horizontal Diversity" to allow us to 'pay' each other without needing to pass tokens.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, we buy/build a dentist office and the tools for simple dental procedures.&nbsp;&nbsp;We must attract or train someone that can operate those tools, and who is willing to commit to do that <a href="work.htm">work</a> for the 'pay' of gaining co-ownership in the <a href="property.htm">property</a> for his housing, food, clothing, transportation, sanitation, etc. combined with commitments of others to operate that <a href="property.htm">property</a> for his benefit in return for his fixing their teeth.&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice this fully replaces traditional insurance.<br/>
<br/>
We will also want to <a href="work.htm">work</a> toward "Vertical Integration" to move away from the need to gather and spend external tokens. For example, we will buy grains and alfalfa at first to feed our chickens and cattle, but will also grow those plants to avoid the need to buy in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;Vertical Integration is a very long-term goal, and we won't co-own mines or factories right away, but will just buy off-the-shelf tools at first, while we are 'booting'.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Part of the initial costs for purchasing the <a href="property.htm">property</a> might be collected from middle-income <a href="consume.htm">consume</a>rs who are willing to pre-pay for organic goods.<br/>
<br/>
Each person would invest just enough <small>(either <a href="money.htm">Money</a>, Land or Capital)</small> to cover the predicted costs of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion for the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t they each intend to use.<br/>
<br/>
Each of these investors would still need to pay their % of the costs as usual, but since they would accept the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t itself as the return for that risk, there would be sale, and so <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> would not exist at all.<br/>
<br/>
Labor will come from skilled artisans initially willing to <a href="work.htm">work</a> in return for food, shelter, basic medical care, etc. with a future payout of real co-ownership in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>.<br/>
<br/>
These <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers must receive real co-ownership in the <a href="property.htm">property</a> for which they need the outputs, but until those facilities are functional, will need to be paid more 'directly' by being housed in tents and fed basic rations, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts are not sold when the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s co-own the <a href="property.htm">property</a> needed for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion because the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is already in the hands of those who will <a href="consume.htm">consume</a> it even before it is <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed.<br/>
<br/>
For example, you do not buy Apples when you co-own an Apple orchard because you *already* own your % of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t according to your % of ownership in the physical <a href="source.htm">Source</a>s <small>(trees, land, water-rights, etc.)</small> needed to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e those apples.<br/>
<br/>
There is no need to pay wages when <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers commit <a href="work.htm">work</a> before <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion begins because compensation comes in the form of co-ownership in the <a href="property.htm">property</a> they need combined with <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s to <a href="work.htm">work</a> on your behalf from others in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>.<br/>
<br/>
For example, if you <a href="promise.htm">promise</a> to pick Apples in return for someone else promising to pick Oranges and someone else <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s to fix your teeth, and someone else <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s to fix your car, etc., then we can enjoy the full benefits of specialization without the problem of double coincidence of wants caused by trading <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts late.<br/>
