A Vertically Integrated Permaculture Mosaic <small>(<a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>)</small> is ecologically and economically closed-loop development platform used to continuously reproduce our biological needs.<br/>
<br/>
It is the land and organisms and tools and all other <a href="property.htm">Property</a> required for the organic resilience of any group of humans.<br/>
<br/>
The minimum size and complexity is based on the projected minimum outputs needed to meet the standard-of-living each participant desires.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Outline</span><br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Potential users pre-pay to purchase land, water-rights,<br/>
&nbsp; tools, plants, animals, etc. required to create basic<br/>
&nbsp; goods and services that most everyone needs such as<br/>
&nbsp; food, shelter, cloth, soap, medicine, sanitation,<br/>
&nbsp; basic health care including dentistry, optometry, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> If a payer has skills needed by others within the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>,<br/>
&nbsp; they can contract to work in exchange for <a href="product future.htm">Product Future</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> After some a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of time, or after some series of events<br/>
&nbsp; the <a href="product future.htm">Product Future</a>s should vest more fully to the payer to<br/>
&nbsp; allow for selling and/or renting of that <a href="property.htm">Property</a> or the<br/>
&nbsp; <a href="product.htm">Product</a>s of that <a href="property.htm">Property</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Initial stages of development might have some workers living<br/>
&nbsp; in tents of mobile <a href="home.htm">home</a>s and eating food bought in bulk and<br/>
&nbsp; prepared on-site in a cafeteria setting.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Later, after the agriculture is installed and producing, the<br/>
&nbsp; system will become "self hosted", being able to support all<br/>
&nbsp; basic needs without external inputs.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Soon afterward the system will be producing <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a> that can<br/>
&nbsp; be sold to outsiders to collect <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> If Venture Capitalists helped fund the operation, part of the<br/>
&nbsp; <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> will be used as their ROI.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> We may want to distribute part of the <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> to the Workers,<br/>
&nbsp; since that is a popular thing to do.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> We may we to distribute part of the <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> to random charities,<br/>
&nbsp; since that is a popular thing to do.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> But we MUST handle some non-zero % of the <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>s as though<br/>
&nbsp; that overpayment were an investment from the payer.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> We should charge <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> during those sales, since if we don't<br/>
&nbsp; collect the <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>, a middle-man will buy all that we offer<br/>
&nbsp; at Cost, and then resell it for a <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> anyway.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> So we will charge <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> against the Payer, but we will also<br/>
&nbsp; treat <small>(at least part of)</small> that magic value as Payer Investment.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> This causes these late-coming users to slowly gain ownership<br/>
&nbsp; and therefore to eventually stop buying that <a href="product.htm">product</a> too.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Similar to how the GNU GPL enforces Copyleft through Copyright,<br/>
&nbsp; we propose to create a <a href="property.htm">Property</a>Left document enforced through<br/>
&nbsp; <a href="property.htm">Property</a> Rights used to apply this requirement to the Aggregate.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> This social contract can be applied by co-owners of any<br/>
&nbsp; material assets to insure <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom for all users.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Notice this is also a literal form of Insurance.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> These users must cover all the real cost of <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion<br/>
&nbsp; just as any owners do, but they do not buy the <a href="product.htm">product</a><br/>
&nbsp; since they own it already - and they don't sell the<br/>
&nbsp; <a href="product.htm">product</a> because they need to use it directly.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> The <a href="product.htm">product</a> is not traded unless there is <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a>, and<br/>
&nbsp; in that case the payer must cover all the Costs of that<br/>
&nbsp; <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion so the <a href="property.htm">Property</a> owner can be compensated for<br/>
&nbsp; paying when they didn't need to.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> The Payer will usually also pay <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>, according to how<br/>
&nbsp; much the "market will bear".&nbsp;&nbsp;Some % of that overpayment<br/>
&nbsp; must be treated as an investment from that payer so the<br/>
&nbsp; growth of the Aggregate is incrementally autodistributed<br/>
&nbsp; to all those willing to pay for that growth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> At some point, and under certain constraints, and mostly<br/>
&nbsp; to resolve disputes, subgroups must finally be allowed to<br/>
&nbsp; fork from the rest while retaining <a href="property.htm">Property</a> ownership.<br/>

<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Incorporating for <a href="product.htm">Product</a> - Investing for Goods<br/>
<br/>
Let's make new corporations owned by the Users of those <a href="product.htm">Product</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
We will organize groups to co-buy the <a href="property.htm">Property</a> needed for <a href="product.htm">Product</a>ion.<br/>
<br/>
We will help workers contract <small>(<a href="promise.htm">Promise</a> or bond)</small> to work in the <a href="future.htm">future</a> in exchange for food and shelter now.<br/>
<br/>
Owners as consumers receive the <a href="product.htm">product</a> itself as a natural return for those investments.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each co-owner of the <a href="product.htm">product</a>ive assets is co-owner of the <a href="product.htm">product</a> in that same a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you own 15% of a milk-cow, then you own 15% of the milk <small>(assuming you 'paid' your portion of the costs)</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This can be true even if you co-own just a tiny % of a large dairy with many other Consumers.<br/>
<br/>
That leaves <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> to be treated as Payer Investment in more <a href="property.htm">Property</a> - to become the real <a href="property.htm">Property</a> of that Consumer - causing him to incrementally gain the ownership in <a href="property.htm">Property</a> that will allow him to finally stop buying that <a href="product.htm">Product</a> late, but instead pay the Costs early and then own the <a href="product.htm">Product</a> as a side-effect of his <a href="property.htm">Property</a> ownership.<br/>
<br/>
We will build new corporations that outperform the Capitalists when we finally recognize <a href="price.htm">Price</a> above Cost as a measure of the Consumer's lack of Ownership - and so must be treated as though that payer had just invested in more <a href="property.htm">Property</a> needed to grow the collective.<br/>
<br/>
This auto-distributes ownership as the organization grows to those willing to pay <small>(whether in Capital or in Work)</small> for that growth.<br/>
<br/>
These for-<a href="product.htm">product</a> corporations will treat <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as a misallocation of <a href="property.htm">Property</a> and 'govern' that steam by reflecting it back to the Payer as his new <small>(probably not yet vested)</small> co-ownership in that growth.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Commentary</span><br/>
Capitalism has achieved much for humanity, but as any business scales in size it becomes clear the goals of that body conflicts with the goals of those it claims to serve.<br/>
<br/>
As society becomes more aware of these troubles, corporations try to hide their goal of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> because we understand Scarcity keeps <a href="price.htm">Price</a> above cost, and therefore striving to perpetuate <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is the very basis of the conflict between <a href="product.htm">Product</a>ion and Consumption.<br/>
<br/>
It may seem there could be no solution since those who traditionally Fund <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion demand <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as a Return for the Risk they take.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are operating under the paradigm of "Exchange Value" which requires some a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of scarcity to keep <a href="price.htm">Price</a> above Cost.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let's re-examine our assumptions about who should Fund and therefore Own the Means of <a href="product.htm">Product</a>ion.<br/>
<br/>
Let's look at the most trivial case of a single person owning a fruit tree for his own benefit.<br/>
<br/>
He must pay all the Costs of ownership, including Wages if he does not do the work himself.<br/>
<br/>
But he cannot pay *more* than Cost, for who would he pay it to?<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is defined as <a href="price.htm">Price</a> above Cost but if he does not sell the <a href="product.htm">product</a>, <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is undefined.<br/>
<br/>
This is all very obvious and might seem unimportant, but let's push the idea a bit further and see what happens:<br/>
<br/>
Imagine now, instead of a single Funder-Owner-User, we have thousands of such investors pooling Funds toward an orchard.<br/>
<br/>
By attracting potential Users to pre-pay for the goods they predict they will need, we can use those Funds to buy the means necessary for that <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion.<br/>
<br/>
The Users and Owners will then be the very same set.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="product.htm">product</a> will not be sold because the ROI for the Risk is <a href="product.htm">Product</a> itself which they attain at Cost.<br/>
<br/>
This solves the 'static' case where the number of Users matches exactly the output of that <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion.<br/>
<br/>
But many of these consuming investors will want to over-own by some percentage to guarantee they have enough <a href="product.htm">product</a> at the round of each <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion.<br/>
<br/>
We must do something with that <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a> or it will rot.<br/>
<br/>
We can sell those <a href="product.htm">product</a>s for <a href="price.htm">Price</a> above Cost - as much as the market will bear - but to keep the organization owned by the Users of those <a href="product.htm">product</a>s, we must treat the payment of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as an investment from the User who paid it so they also gain ownership in the <a href="property.htm">Property</a> needed for <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Another Explanation</span><br/>
In the attached picture "Capitalism.png" we see investors in the upper-left corner funding <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion and receiving Title in that <a href="property.htm">Property</a>.<br/>
<br/>
All Costs, including Worker wages, are initially paid from that pool of funding.<br/>
<br/>
The Consumer <small>(in blue)</small> begins to paying for those Costs in his <small>(late)</small> quest to buy Objects.<br/>
<br/>
Over time, if the business is successful, the investors receive all they had initially put forward and then begin receiving the special value called <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The Consumer never gains any <a href="property.htm">Property</a> ownership under this arrangement.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span>..<br/>
<br/>
In the attached picture "Patched-Capitalism.png" we see again see investors in the upper-left corner funding <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion and receiving Title in that <a href="property.htm">Property</a>, but this time the investors are *also* Consumers of the <a href="future.htm">future</a> <a href="product.htm">product</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are taking risk for the purpose of receiving at-cost <a href="product.htm">Product</a> under their full control.<br/>
<br/>
After each round of <a href="product.htm">Product</a>ion, the Objects are not sold <small>(except in cases of <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a>)</small>, because they are already the <a href="property.htm">Property</a> of those who will consume them.<br/>
<br/>
The heavy line indicates there is no transfer of ownership, but shows the funders are already the owners without any need to purchase since they paid all the Costs of <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion and are the owners as a side-effect of their <a href="property.htm">Property</a> ownership.<br/>
<br/>
The bottom of the picture shows a Consumer with insufficient ownership buying Objects late and probably paying <a href="price.htm">Price</a> above Cost.<br/>
<br/>
But in this case, that overpayment is treated as an investment from the Consumer who paid it - causing him to unwittingly Fund the purchase and care of even *more* <a href="property.htm">Property</a> that will eventually begin producing and therefore provide him with that which he needs.<br/>
<br/>
This allows the organization to grow and yet remain distributed as all new ownership is 'reflected' back to those willing to pay for that growth.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Most countries, such as the United States, only tax imputed income in certain situations, such as the calculation of domestic partner employee benefits.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is sometimes difficult to measure, and there can be political consequences to doing so.&nbsp;&nbsp;From the perspective of taxpayers, this creates a tax benefit in favor of owning over renting, and in favor of self-service over hiring.&nbsp;&nbsp;From the perspective of the economy, this distorts economic activity away from activities that are associated with the division of labor. - <a class="ext" href="http://Wikipedia.org/wiki/Imputed_income">http://Wikipedia.org/wiki/Imputed_income</a><br/>

<br/>
<span class="h2">==Mantra for a GNU Economy</span><br/>
<br/>
If Consumers were investors, and their return was the <a href="product.htm">product</a>, we could get what we need without buying or selling, and would trade only <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
But for those not yet part of such a scheme, <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> charged against those late consumers would be treated as an investment from that payer.<br/>
<br/>
This eliminates part of the need for <a href="money.htm">money</a>, since the <small>(co-)</small>owner of an Avocado tree does not buy Avocados, but owns them already as a side-effect of owning the <a href="property.htm">Property</a> required for that <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Imputed <a href="product.htm">Product</a>ion</span><br/>
Imagine a <a href="crowd.htm">crowd</a>-funded corporation where the only shareholders were the very consumers of that <a href="product.htm">product</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Their ROI for taking risk would be to avoid paying <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> - since the owner of an Apple tree does not *buy* the Apples from himself, but owns those Objectives already, as a side-effect of his <a href="property.htm">Property</a> ownership.<br/>
<br/>
There would no longer be "Vendor/Customer" relations to worry about since the Vendor and Customer would be one and the same!<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="product.htm">product</a> would not be sold back to each investor-consumer-owner, but it is already their <a href="property.htm">Property</a> according to the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> they invested - whether they invested with <a href="money.htm">money</a> or with labor.<br/>
<br/>
The owner of a milk cow does not buy the milk from himself, but owns it already as a result of his owning the cow.<br/>
<br/>
A cooperative SELLS the <a href="product.htm">product</a> back to the consumer-owners - thereby collecting !<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>! and coming under the scrutiny of government restrictions <small>(for example it is illegal to sell raw milk in some part of the US)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
In cases where an agent has invested more than he can use directly, he can sell that <a href="product.htm">product</a> to agents who do not yet have sufficient ownership, but under the strict condition <small>(enforced by a Terms of Operation over that organization)</small> that any <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> collected during that sale be treated as an investment from that payer - so the organization can grow in size while avoiding the troubles of centralization and overaccumulation that plague nearly every other endeavor that even begins to succeed.<br/>
<br/>
There is no reason to worry about the workers - for that is who I am protecting, but am protecting their ability to consume instead of trying to prop-up wages and avoid automation.<br/>
<br/>
Wishing the machines would just stop <small>(as John Henry)</small> will become less and less of an option as the robots are coming to take the work away - and we can be *happy* about that if we are working on the right side of the equation!<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, even without robots, wages and <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> will approach zero as the Means of <a href="product.htm">Product</a>ion become cheaper, since there will be no way to stop willing workers from accessing those tools and thereby providing the solutions consumers seek.<br/>
<br/>
Workers can invest more than they are able to consume, but it won't do them any good when the consumers already have sufficient ownership needed to protect themselves from workers who try to stop other peers from doing that work by blocking access to <a href="property.htm">Property</a> needed for <a href="product.htm">Product</a>ion.<br/>
<br/>
Workers cannot protect wages through ownership if other consumers already have sufficient ownership because propping wages requires the worker be able to STOP other potential workers from accessing the <a href="property.htm">Property</a>, and why would a group stop a peer from bidding to do a job especially since in some cases they might even do that work for <a href="free.htm">free</a> <small>(gratis)</small> because they see it as play.<br/>
<br/>
Workers who invest and co-own more of the Apple orchard than they are able to consume will not be able to prop-up wages because the other co-owners will always have the option to do the work for themselves or to hire the lowest bidder.<br/>
<br/>
When the consumers around those workers have sufficient ownership, they will not be buying the <a href="product.htm">product</a> from anyone, but will own it already as a side-effect of their owning the <a href="property.htm">Property</a> needed for that <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion.<br/>
<br/>
You may be tempted to dismiss this as simply a Consumer Cooperative, but this is absolutely NOT a Consumer Cooperative.<br/>
<br/>
1,)</small> Consumer Cooperatives *sell* the <a href="product.htm">product</a> back to the co-owners and collect a <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> during that transaction that a committee then doles out in a Tyranny of the Majority fashion.<br/>
<br/>
1a.)</small> Imputed <a href="product.htm">Product</a>ion only sells <a href="product.htm">product</a> to non-owners, and only when there is <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a>, and treats that <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as an investment from that payer - causing ownership and control to be automatically distributed at the point of sale back to the actor who was willing to pay for it. This system minimizes and nearly eliminates the trading of goods since the <a href="property.htm">Property</a> owner of does not buy the Objective, but owns it already as a result of his <a href="property.htm">Property</a> ownership.&nbsp;&nbsp;The trading of goods will tend toward zero but does not reach stasis because of newcomers into the system <small>(even just babies being born)</small>, and because people's interests change across time.<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> Consumer Cooperatives are "Democratically Controlled" with one-member/one-vote.<br/>
<br/>
2a.)</small> Imputed <a href="product.htm">Product</a>ion is far more autarchic- where any member can 'fork' his portion of the <a href="property.htm">Property</a> and secede from the union or sell those shares if a split is attempted that is finer than reasonable divisibility <small>(you can't both feed a single milk-cow grain and NOT feed that cow grain, but can divide a herd)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
2b.)</small> Each member has exactly as much vote power as he has ownership. If you own 11% of a roto-tiller and your neighbor owns 22%, then you have only half as much vote power in decisions such as "how often should we change the oil".<br/>
<br/>
3.)</small> Every Consumer Cooperative I know of is only concerned with buying <a href="product.htm">product</a>s that were made by Capitalists.<br/>
<br/>
3a.)</small> Imputed <a href="product.htm">Product</a>ion is primarily about ownership and control of the entire tree of <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion - recursively, and works toward a Vertically Integrated Commons where we, the people, own the farms and factories and land and water rights and all the other <a href="property.htm">Property</a> and supporting <a href="property.htm">Property</a> required to reproduce those things.<br/>
<br/>
We don't need to transform politicians, and do not have enough <a href="money.htm">money</a> to buy such changes anyway.<br/>
<br/>
All we need to do is start businesses that are funded and owned by Consumers and that treat <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as payer investment.<br/>
<br/>
Customers *already* pay all the Costs of <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion. We, the consumers, foot the entire bill. And we *also* pay <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> because we choose to pay late.<br/>
<br/>
But if we could organize to pay early - to collectively purchase the <a href="property.htm">Property</a> needed to produce the <a href="product.htm">product</a>s we need - then, we would still need to pay all costs.<br/>
<br/>
But since we would own the objective as a side-effect of our <a href="property.htm">Property</a> ownership, we would not be 'buying' from ourselves, and so COULD NOT pay <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>, for that final transaction would not even occur!<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is UNDEFINED when the Customers are the Owners of the Means of <a href="product.htm">Product</a>ion.<br/>
<br/>
And instead of taking a stance through <a href="property.htm">Property</a> ownership, we beg and plead with the current owners to "please do the right thing" - even though the current owners have NO POSSIBLE CHANCE of "doing the right thing" for they owe investors who expect <a href="price.htm">Price</a> be kept above Cost.<br/>
<br/>
And <a href="price.htm">Price</a> can only be kept above Cost during Scarcity.<br/>
<br/>
So we see the drive for Scarcity is caused by choosing investors who expect <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as a return.<br/>
<br/>
The drive for Scarcity can be eliminated by choosing investors who expect <a href="product.htm">Product</a> as a return.<br/>
<br/>
But only Customers can use <a href="product.htm">Product</a> as a return.<br/>
<br/>
So the answer is to attract Customers to pre-pay for <a href="product.htm">Product</a> - while using those pre-payments as actual investments which are then <a href="property.htm">Property</a> co-owned by those Customers who benefit from the use-value of that <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion, and never need strive for Scarcity, for the <a href="product.htm">product</a> will usually never be sold.<br/>
<br/>
In the case where a Customer-Owner has too much <a href="product.htm">product</a>: the solution is to sell that <a href="product.htm">product</a> to non-owners, and even to charge <a href="price.htm">Price</a> above Cost <small>(<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>)</small> against those late comers *BUT* - here is the trick - the <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> received must be treated as though that Customer had just made an investment toward even more <a href="product.htm">product</a>ive <a href="property.htm">Property</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Treating <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as that payer's investment will allow the collective to include others while simultaneously avoiding the typical problems of overaccumulation and excessive concentration of control that cause even the most well-intentioned organizations to finally fail to meet the needs of those they were initially formed to serve <small>(the customers of course!)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
This is somewhat like a "short circuit" across the typical market.<br/>
<br/>
Where the consumers do not buy the finished goods, but own them already - even before they are completed - as a side-effect of their <a href="property.htm">Property</a> ownership.<br/>
<br/>
If you own an Apple tree, you do not *buy* the apples from yourself.<br/>
<br/>
If you and your neighbor co-own an Apple, you need not *buy* the apples from your collective 'self'.<br/>
<br/>
If you 999 other people co-own an Apple orchard, you need not *buy* the apples from your collective 'self'.<br/>
<br/>
This has other benefits such as:<br/>
<br/>
1.)</small> Since the <a href="product.htm">product</a> is not sold, there is no chance for the government to collect sales tax.<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> Since the <a href="product.htm">product</a> is not sold, there is no chance for the government to disallow that <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion <small>(buying raw milk is illegal in many parts of the US)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Another Outline</span><br/>
Attract middle-income Consumers to pre-pay for organic <a href="product.htm">product</a>s and earth-friendly services.<br/>
Hybrid Option: Attract traditional Venture Capitalists, and pay them a % of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> gathered during growth.<br/>
Hybrid Option: Attract corporations like Pepsi, Nike, etc. who fund <a href="projects.htm">projects</a> for Public Relations purposes.<br/>
<br/>
Use part of the funds to buy cheap agricultural land without mortgage.<br/>
Use part of the funds to buy tools, plants, animals, water rights.<br/>
Use part of the funds to buy 'startup' needs of workers such as tents, bulk food, used clothing, first-aid materials, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Attract Workers to build and operate the infrastructure by providing a "Basic Outcome" that covers all of: housing, all utilities <small>(electricity, gas, sewer, recycling)</small>, transportation, and even food, water, medicine, clothing, comprehensive health care, child-care, education, - eventually all the things the corporations and governments currently control instead of smaller groups.<br/>
<br/>
Occupy that land with tents to begin planting and building.<br/>
Will want to qualify as non-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a> to avoid <a href="property.htm">Property</a> taxes.<br/>
<br/>
Each Investor <small>(whether committing <a href="money.htm">money</a> or work)</small> becomes a co-owner of some <a href="property.htm">Property</a> within the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Each worker receives the 'level' of Basic Outcome according to the quantity and quality of work they commit to achieve in the <a href="future.htm">future</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Others commit their <a href="future.htm">future</a> labor in return for accepting your commitments.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> If you want the studio apartment, a 5 minute shower, and very simple meals, you will not need to commit very much of your <a href="future.htm">future</a> labor.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> If you want a 5-bedroom house want to shares in the clubhouse and more difficult meals, you will need to commit more of your <a href="future.htm">future</a> labor in order to compensate others for the extra work and land and tools<br/>
<br/>
We do not pay wages, but that is ok since the worker does not need to buy most of the goods and services he needs.<br/>
<br/>
We do not sell the <a href="product.htm">Product</a>s <small>(except <a href="surplus.htm">Surplus</a>)</small> because all of that output is in the correct hands even before it is produced.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Overview</span><br/>
Investors become co-Owners in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> according to the value they commit as measured by the others in that subgroup.<br/>
<br/>
The Consumers do not buy the <a href="product.htm">Product</a>s from the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>, but instead they come by to claim what is already theirs.<br/>
<br/>
For example, if you like milk and honey, then you will need co-Ownership in cattle and bees and all their inputs, <small>(land, shelter, food, medicine)</small>, and the things needed to create those things <small>(plants, animals, tools)</small>, recursively through the entire tree of <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Timeline</span><br/>
The vision of <a href="future.htm">future</a> <a href="product.htm">product</a> is proposed.<br/>
We must estimate the scale and level of vertical integration needed for that, balancing more immediate needs with longer term goals.<br/>
Then we write a 'recipe' for that <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion which includes<br/>
&nbsp;A list of <a href="property.htm">Property</a> needed<br/>
&nbsp;A list of <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s needed<br/>
We issue <a href="product future.htm">Product Future</a>s against those <a href="property.htm">Property</a> and <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s.<br/>
We sell the <a href="product future.htm">Product Future</a>s to purchase the <a href="property.htm">Property</a>.<br/>
Some will pay with commitments of <a href="property.htm">Property</a>, usually by commitments plain-old-<a href="money.htm">money</a>.<br/>
Some will pay with commitments of <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s by committing to work in the <a href="future.htm">future</a>.<br/>
Once we have all the needed <a href="property.htm">Property</a> and <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s, we can begin <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion.<br/>
After the first round of <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion, <a href="product.htm">Product</a>s are distributed to each investor based on their % of ownership.<br/>
Owners with <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a> <a href="product.htm">Product</a> have the option to sell to non-owners to cover the costs of that <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion.<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> will be collected from the non-owners <small>(as much as the market will bear)</small>, and is treated as they payer's investment toward more <a href="property.htm">Property</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When workers commit <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s, they receive ownership in the <a href="property.htm">Property</a> of that which they needs the <a href="product.htm">Product</a>s, not necessarily in that which they know how to operate or maintain.<br/>
<br/>
So, if you want "Dental Assurance", you need co-ownership in the land and capital needed to perform dentistry, and then you 'hire' any Dentist to fix your teeth by cross-committing <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s to work on behalf of that dentist in return for his <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a> to fix your teeth when needed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Startup</span><br/>
The initial boot-up phase of the operation will have construction workers living in tents and eating cafeteria-style meals some of them prepare from bulk-bought food as they build their own housing and get the agriculture running.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="product.htm">Product</a>ive landscaping <small>(permascaping)</small> will eventually provide all of the nutrition and medical needs of the co-owners, but there is a "lead time" for all <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion, and for some plants and animals, it could be years before the <a href="product.htm">Product</a>s are available.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means some of the Consumer pre-payments must be used to purchase bulk food to feed the Workers until the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> is ecologically closed-loop.<br/>
<br/>
Articles of Organization/Incorporation<br/>
<br/>
Mission Statement or Statement of Purpose<br/>
&nbsp;Foster the mutually-assured <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion of food, housing, sanitation, transport, child-care and education, health-care.<br/>
<br/>
Project Charter, Terms of Reference<br/>
&nbsp;Vision, Scope, Goal<br/>

Investment forms:<br/>
<br/>
Committing <a href="property.htm">Property</a> relinquishes some % to others in the group.<br/>
<br/>
Examples include land, water-rights, tools, buildings, plants, animals, etc.<br/>
<br/>
1.)</small> <a href="product.htm">Product</a> is Investor's Return: This is an Investment strategy that uses <a href="product.htm">Product</a> as the ROI, and so requires the Investors be the Users themselves.<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is Payer Investment: This is a Revenue-Sharing strategy that Invests some % of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> for the User who paid it.<br/>
<br/>
3.)</small> Investments are Commitments of <a href="property.htm">Property</a> or <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s: This is a way to gather the Land and Capital needed <small>(those committing <a href="property.htm">Property</a> would relinquish ownership to others in a group targeting some specific <a href="product.htm">Product</a>)</small> and also to insure the diverse work needed would be accomplished without need to fight the "simultaneous coincidence of wants" trouble with typical 'late' barter.<br/>
<br/>
Promising to work *before* <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion begins allows us to trade Labor between ourselves and never need to trade oranges with apples, since the co-owners of the <a href="property.htm">Property</a> own their % of the <a href="product.htm">Product</a> *already*, even before they are produced.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is "Predictive Barter" - where we <a href="property.htm">Property</a> and <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s are preallocated to those who need the <a href="product.htm">Product</a>s.<br/>
