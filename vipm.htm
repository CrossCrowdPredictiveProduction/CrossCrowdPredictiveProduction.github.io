<br/>
A Vertically Integrated Permaculture Mosaic <small>(<a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>)</small> is a loosely coupled collection of the <a href="source.htm">source</a>s required to re<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e all the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts we need, bound by the constraints of the <a href="iota.htm">IOTA</a>.<br/>
<br/>
A <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> is composed of many intradependent businesses that are each co-owned by the future <a href="consume.htm">consume</a>rs of each <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, a chicken farm for those who want eggs, a dental office for those who want&nbsp;&nbsp;assurance of dental, cattle and bees for those who want milk and honey.<br/>
<br/>
Each investor can own any a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of <a href="source.htm">source</a>s <small>(such chickens, dental tools, cattle, bees)</small>, and owns the same portion of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts <small>(eggs, healthy teeth, milk, honey)</small> without buying anything except <a href="source.htm">source</a>s that are not yet <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts of vertical integration.<br/>
<br/>
For example, we might buy feed for the cattle and chickens at first, but will plant alfalfa and grains to bring that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion local.<br/>
<br/>
That is an obvious and easy example, but we will incrementally target the more difficult <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts such as raising the plants or animals to retrieve fibers we will spin into thread, weave into cloth, cut and sew into our clothing.<br/>
<br/>
As more <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>s become operational, our goals can expand to much larger targets, for example, building spinnerets, looms, sewing machines and some of the tools to capture the power they need.<br/>
<br/>
Much later, when there are hundreds or thousands of <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>s, all that we need will be possible simply by dedicating <a href="property.htm">property</a> and <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s to that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
We will own mines and foundries and wells and refineries and all the tools needed to create whatever we dream without paying tribute to anyone.<br/>
<br/>
The minimum size and complexity of a <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> is bound both by the desired quality-of-life and by the completeness of vertical integration.<br/>
<br/>
The initial boot-up phase may require <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers live in tents and eat cafeteria-style meals that they prepare from bulk purchases until they have built the first of the permanent structures and before the agriculture is fully operational.<br/>
<br/>
We will eventually grow most of the inputs for food, soap, cloth, medicine, and building materials on site, but this could take years for some <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts, so some <a href="property.htm">property</a> investments must be <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers need immediately so they have basic food, clothing, shelter, first-aid, etc. as we slowly increase vertical integration.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Bootup</span><br/>
Estimate the quantity and quality food, housing, sanitation, clothing, basic health-care, child care, transportation, etc. needed to support on-site <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
Estimate the <a href="property.htm">property</a> and <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s needed for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and issue <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>s toward those goals.<br/>
<br/>
Sell those <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>s for commitments of <a href="property.htm">property</a> and <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
Part of the <a href="property.htm">property</a> must be the physical <a href="source.htm">source</a>s such as land, tools, organisms, lumber, wire, pipe, etc. needed to create and operate the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The rest must be 'bootup' goods such as tents, bulk-food, used clothing, first-aid kits, etc. needed to support <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers until the agriculture is <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive and before the permanent shelters are complete.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>, we may also need to sell some <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>s for <a href="money.htm">money</a> to secure commitments of external services that are not yet available on-site such as dental <a href="work.htm">work</a>, extended health care, long-distance travel, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Potential <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers look at the list of <a href="work.htm">work</a> needed and signup to fulfill the '<a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s' portion of some <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>s for which they have skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a group of owners accept those <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s, the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er is 'paid' by that group with <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>s capable of generating one of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts he needs and, initially, by also receiving a portion of the bootup goods and external services needed until we are fully bootstrapped.<br/>
<br/>
Once we have purchased the <a href="property.htm">property</a> and secured the <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s, we can begin installing the agriculture and building the first of the shared structures.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Outline</span><br/>
Potential <a href="user.htm">user</a>s pre-pay to purchase land, water-rights, tools, plants, animals, etc. required to create basic goods and services they need such as food, shelter, cloth, soap, medicine, sanitation, basic health care including dentistry, optometry, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Some pre-pay with <a href="money.htm">money</a> used to buy <a href="property.htm">property</a> while others pre-pay with <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s as commitments to complete the needed <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
After some a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of time, or after some series of events the <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>s vest more fully to the payer, allowing him to sell the <a href="source.htm">source</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
At some point, and under certain constraints, and mostly to resolve disputes, subgroups must finally be allowed to fork from the rest while retaining <a href="source.htm">Source</a> ownership.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Commentary</span><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Incorporating for <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t - Investing for Goods<br/>
<br/>
Let's make new corporations owned by the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s of those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts.<br/>
<br/>
We will organize groups to co-buy the <a href="property.htm">property</a> needed for <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
We will organize <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers to <a href="promise.htm">promise</a> to <a href="work.htm">work</a> in the future in exchange for ownership in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Each investor <small>(whether of <a href="property.htm">property</a> or of <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s)</small> becomes a real co-owner in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> and receives the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t itself as a natural return for those investments.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each co-owner of the <a href="source.htm">source</a>s is co-owner of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts in that same a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a>.<br/>
<br/>
For example, if you own .15% of a dairy, then you own .15% of the milk.<br/>
<br/>
That leaves <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> to be treated as payer investment in more <a href="source.htm">source</a>s - to become the real <a href="property.htm">property</a> of that <a href="consume.htm">consume</a>r - causing him to incrementally gain the ownership in <a href="property.htm">property</a> that will allow him to finally stop buying that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t late, but instead pay the costs early and then own the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t as a side-effect of his <a href="property.htm">property</a> ownership.<br/>
<br/>
This auto-distributes ownership to those who pay for that growth.<br/>
<br/>
In this way we treat <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as misallocated <a href="property.htm">property</a> that is 'reflected' back to the payer as ownership in <a href="source.htm">source</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;This must not be a payout of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t or a break on the <a href="price.htm">price</a>, for such do not create a functional negative-feedback loop.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Commentary</span><br/>
Capitalism has achieved much for humanity, but as any business scales in size it becomes clear the goals of that body conflicts with the goals of those it claims to serve.<br/>
<br/>
As society becomes more aware of these troubles, corporations try to hide their goal of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> because we understand Scarcity keeps <a href="price.htm">Price</a> above cost, and therefore striving to perpetuate <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is the very basis of the conflict between <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion and Consumption.<br/>
<br/>
It may seem there could be no solution since those who traditionally Fund <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion demand <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as a Return for the Risk they take.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are operating under the paradigm of "Exchange Value" which requires some a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of scarcity to keep <a href="price.htm">Price</a> above Cost.<br/>
<br/>
Let's re-examine our assumptions about who should Fund and therefore Own the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
Let's look at the most trivial case of a single person owning a fruit tree for his own benefit.<br/>
<br/>
He must pay all the Costs of ownership, including Wages if he does not do the <a href="work.htm">work</a> himself.<br/>
<br/>
But he cannot pay *more* than Cost, for who would he pay it to?<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is defined as <a href="price.htm">Price</a> above Cost but if he does not sell the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t, <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is undefined.<br/>
<br/>
This is all very obvious and might seem unimportant, but let's push the idea a bit further and see what happens:<br/>
<br/>
Imagine now, instead of a single Funder-Owner-<a href="user.htm">User</a>, we have thousands of such investors pooling Funds toward an orchard.<br/>
<br/>
By attracting potential <a href="user.htm">User</a>s to pre-pay for the goods they predict they will need, we can use those Funds to buy the means necessary for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="user.htm">User</a>s and Owners will then be the very same set.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t will not be sold because the ROI for the Risk is <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t itself which they attain at Cost.<br/>
<br/>
This solves the 'static' case where the number of <a href="user.htm">User</a>s matches exactly the output of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
But many of these consuming investors will want to over-own by some percentage to guarantee they have enough <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t at the round of each <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
We must do something with that <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a> or it will rot.<br/>
<br/>
We can sell those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts for <a href="price.htm">Price</a> above Cost - as much as the market will bear - but to keep the organization owned by the <a href="user.htm">User</a>s of those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts, we must treat the payment of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as an investment from the <a href="user.htm">User</a> who paid it so they also gain ownership in the <a href="property.htm">Property</a> needed for <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Another Outline</span><br/>
Attract middle-income <a href="consume.htm">Consume</a>rs to pre-pay for organic <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts and earth-friendly services.<br/>
<br/>
Hybrid Option: Attract traditional Venture Capitalists, and pay them a % of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> gathered during growth.<br/>
<br/>
Hybrid Option: Attract corporations like Pepsi, Nike, etc. who fund <a href="projects.htm">projects</a> for Public Relations purposes.<br/>
<br/>
Use part of the funds to buy cheap agricultural land without mortgage.<br/>
<br/>
Use part of the funds to buy tools, plants, animals, water rights.<br/>
<br/>
Use part of the funds to buy 'startup' needs of <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers such as tents, bulk food, used clothing, first-aid materials, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Attract <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers to build and operate the infrastructure by providing a "Basic Outcome" that covers all of: housing, all utilities <small>(electricity, gas, sewer, recycling)</small>, transportation, and even food, water, medicine, clothing, comprehensive health care, child-care, education, - eventually all the things the corporations and governments currently control instead of smaller groups.<br/>
<br/>
Occupy that land with tents to begin planting and building.<br/>
Will want to qualify as non-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a> to avoid <a href="property.htm">Property</a> taxes.<br/>
<br/>
Each Investor <small>(whether committing <a href="money.htm">money</a> or <a href="work.htm">work</a>)</small> becomes a co-owner of some <a href="property.htm">Property</a> within the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Each <a href="work.htm">work</a>er receives the 'level' of Basic Outcome according to the quantity and quality of <a href="work.htm">work</a> they commit to achieve in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Others commit their future labor in return for accepting your commitments.<br/>
<br/>
If you want the studio apartment, a 5 minute shower, and very simple meals, you will not need to commit very much of your future labor.<br/>
<br/>
If you want a 5-bedroom house want to shares in the clubhouse and more difficult meals, you will need to commit more of your future labor in order to compensate others for the extra <a href="work.htm">work</a> and land and tools<br/>
<br/>
We do not pay wages, but that is ok since the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er does not need to buy most of the goods and services he needs.<br/>
<br/>
We do not sell the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts <small>(except <a href="surplus.htm">Surplus</a>)</small> because all of that output is in the correct hands even before it is <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Overview</span><br/>
Investors become co-Owners in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> according to the value they commit as measured by the others in that subgroup.<br/>
<br/>
Each co-owner of <a href="source.htm">source</a>s is the co-owner of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts even before <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion is complete.&nbsp;&nbsp;You might say they each own their portion of all *potential* <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts.&nbsp;&nbsp;They do not buy the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts from the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>, but must only claim that which is already their <a href="property.htm">property</a>.<br/>
<br/>
For example, if you like milk and honey, then you will need co-ownership in cattle and bees and all other <a href="source.htm">source</a>ss, <small>(land, shelter, food, medicine)</small>, and the things needed to create those things <small>(plants, animals, tools)</small>, recursively through the entire tree of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Timeline</span><br/>
The vision of future <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is proposed.<br/>
We must estimate the scale and level of vertical integration needed for that, balancing more immediate needs with longer term goals.<br/>
Then we write a 'recipe' for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion which includes<br/>
&nbsp;A list of <a href="property.htm">Property</a> needed<br/>
&nbsp;A list of <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s needed<br/>
We issue <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>s against those <a href="property.htm">Property</a> and <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s.<br/>
We sell the <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>s to purchase the <a href="property.htm">Property</a>.<br/>
Some will pay with commitments of <a href="property.htm">Property</a>, usually by commitments plain-old-<a href="money.htm">money</a>.<br/>
Some will pay with commitments of <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s by committing to <a href="work.htm">work</a> in the future.<br/>
Once we have all the needed <a href="property.htm">Property</a> and <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s, we can begin <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
After the first round of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts are distributed to each investor based on their % of ownership.<br/>
Owners with <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t have the option to sell to non-owners to cover the costs of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> will be collected from the non-owners <small>(as much as the market will bear)</small>, and is treated as they payer's investment toward more <a href="property.htm">Property</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers commit <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s, they receive ownership in the <a href="property.htm">Property</a> of that which they needs the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts, not necessarily in that which they know how to operate or maintain.<br/>
<br/>
So, if you want "Dental Assurance", you need co-ownership in the land and capital needed to perform dentistry, and then you 'hire' any Dentist to fix your teeth by cross-committing <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s to <a href="work.htm">work</a> on behalf of that dentist in return for his <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a> to fix your teeth when needed.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Promising to <a href="work.htm">work</a> *before* <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion begins allows us to trade Labor between ourselves and never need to trade oranges with apples, since the co-owners of the <a href="property.htm">Property</a> own their % of the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t *already*, even before they are <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is "Predictive Barter" - where we <a href="property.htm">Property</a> and <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s are preallocated to those who need the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A functional <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> will require a minimum "Horizontal Diversity" to allow us to 'pay' each other without needing to pass tokens.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, we buy/build a dentist office and the tools for simple dental procedures.&nbsp;&nbsp;We must attract or train someone that can operate those tools, and who is willing to commit to do that <a href="work.htm">work</a> for the 'pay' of gaining co-ownership in the <a href="property.htm">property</a> for his housing, food, clothing, transportation, sanitation, etc. combined with commitments of others to operate that <a href="property.htm">property</a> for his benefit in return for his fixing their teeth.&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice this fully replaces traditional insurance.<br/>
<br/>
We will also want to <a href="work.htm">work</a> toward "Vertical Integration" to move away from the need to gather and spend external tokens. For example, we will buy grains and alfalfa at first to feed our chickens and cattle, but will also grow those plants to avoid the need to buy in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;Vertical Integration is a very long-term goal, and we won't co-own mines or factories right away, but will just buy off-the-shelf tools at first, while we are 'booting'.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Part of the initial costs for purchasing the <a href="property.htm">property</a> might be collected from middle-income <a href="consume.htm">consume</a>rs who are willing to pre-pay for organic goods.<br/>
<br/>
Each person would invest just enough <small>(either <a href="money.htm">Money</a>, Land or Capital)</small> to cover the predicted costs of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion for the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t they each intend to use.<br/>
<br/>
Each of these investors would still need to pay their % of the costs as usual, but since they would accept the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t itself as the return for that risk, there would be sale, and so <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> would not exist at all.<br/>
<br/>
Labor will come from skilled artisans initially willing to <a href="work.htm">work</a> in return for food, shelter, basic medical care, etc. with a future payout of real co-ownership in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>.<br/>
<br/>
These <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers must receive real co-ownership in the <a href="property.htm">property</a> for which they need the outputs, but until those facilities are functional, will need to be paid more 'directly' by being housed in tents and fed basic rations, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts are not sold when the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s co-own the <a href="property.htm">property</a> needed for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion because the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is already in the hands of those who will <a href="consume.htm">consume</a> it even before it is <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed.<br/>
<br/>
For example, you do not buy Apples when you co-own an Apple orchard because you *already* own your % of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t according to your % of ownership in the physical <a href="source.htm">Source</a>s <small>(trees, land, water-rights, etc.)</small> needed to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e those apples.<br/>
<br/>
There is no need to pay wages when <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers commit <a href="work.htm">work</a> before <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion begins because compensation comes in the form of co-ownership in the <a href="property.htm">property</a> they need combined with <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s to <a href="work.htm">work</a> on your behalf from others in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>.<br/>
<br/>
For example, if you <a href="promise.htm">promise</a> to pick Apples in return for someone else promising to pick Oranges and someone else <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s to fix your teeth, and someone else <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s to fix your car, etc., then we can enjoy the full benefits of specialization without the problem of double coincidence of wants caused by trading <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts late.<br/>
