A <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a> represents:<br/>
0. A <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t of a projected quality and quantity at some rate across time.<br/>
1. The <a href="property.htm">Property</a> needed for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion held under the terms of the <a href="iota.htm">IOTA</a>.<br/>
2. The <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s needed for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion committed by qualified <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
This insures any <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t for as much as the <a href="property.htm">Property</a> and <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s can be secured.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Examples</span><br/>
0. <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t:&nbsp;&nbsp;One dozen grade A, medium chicken eggs every week.<br/>
1. <a href="property.htm">Property</a>: Co-ownership in land and tools etc. of a chicken farm and to grow feed.<br/>
2. <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s: Contractural agreements from all the people required to run a chicken farm.<br/>
<br/>
0. <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t:&nbsp;&nbsp;Two rides on the west-side bus between 8am and 8pm every day.<br/>
1. <a href="property.htm">Property</a>: Co-ownership in bus and tools etc. to operate and maintain the bus fleet.<br/>
2. <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s: Contractural agreements from all the people required to operate and maintain the bus fleet.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Sharing <a href="property.htm">Property</a></span><br/>
Goods are preallocated when the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s commit <a href="property.htm">property</a> toward future <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
For example, owning .13% of an orchard means you automatically own .13% of the fruit.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Swapping <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s</span><br/>
Services are predictively scheduled when <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers commit <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s toward future <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
For example, picking more than your portion of the fruit in the orchard means you have done <a href="work.htm">work</a> for other orchard owners.<br/>
<br/>
Trading <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s to <a href="work.htm">work</a> before <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion begins allows us to specialize without passing tokens while also solving the "simultaneous coincidence of wants" problem that faces typical barter.<br/>
<br/>
This nearly eliminates the need to use <a href="money.htm">money</a> at all, since the goods and services are already the <a href="property.htm">property</a> of those who need them.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. A may commit to <a href="work.htm">work</a> for Ms. B in return for Ms. B committing to <a href="work.htm">work</a> for Mr. A.<br/>
<br/>
But more complex chains can also be arranged such as A <a href="work.htm">work</a>s for B and B <a href="work.htm">work</a>s for C and C <a href="work.htm">work</a>s A, etc.<br/>
<br/>
As a <a href="work.htm">work</a>er, you may choose to sign such contracts for anyone willing to accept your expertise.&nbsp;&nbsp;These commitments are real investments.<br/>
<br/>
Other investments are commitments of Land or Capital, or whenever you pay <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> within the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>s are a combination of:<br/>
<br/>
1. <a href="property.htm">Property</a> ownership in the <a href="source.htm">source</a>s for which you need <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, someone who drinks milk would want ownership in cattle while someone who uses honey would want ownership in bees.<br/>
<br/>
2. <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s from other <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers within the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> to supply the labor needed to operate and maintain that <a href="property.htm">property</a> on your behalf.&nbsp;&nbsp;While you are fixing cars or painting buildings, those with whom you swapped skills will be milking cows and gathering honey.<br/>
<br/>
Co-owners should advertise minimum allowable standards to avoid attracting <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers unwilling to meet those constraints.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>s are an imperfect insurance for any goods or service you may wish to guarantee, and backed by the physical <a href="source.htm">source</a>s required for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It might be useful to also issue 'tickets' against future payout instances to more closely resemble typical currency.<br/>
<br/>
Each ticket would have a window of validity - where it could only be used after a starting time and before an ending time.<br/>
<br/>
Ideally the <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>s and tickets will be electronic, but this is not required.<br/>
<br/>
This accounting is important to defend ourselves against someone who might try to take more than they own.<br/>
<br/>
Each <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a> represents the societal need as assessed by <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t <a href="user.htm">user</a>s according to the full <a href="price.htm">price</a> paid - where paying up to cost indicates worth, and paying any a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> over cost indicates a desire to grow.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>s are issued in response to any investment type, including when <a href="user.htm">user</a>s pay <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is accepted during the sale of <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a> and then offered back to that payer as unvested <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
The payers of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> gain <a href="property.htm">property</a> ownership in exactly the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> they pay above cost.&nbsp;&nbsp;This distributes control to those willing to pay for that growth so <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts become <a href="free.htm">Free</a> <small>(as in <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom)</small> for every <a href="user.htm">user</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To insure <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion continues, a <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a> owner must either:<br/>
1. Provide all the <a href="source.htm">source</a>s needed to cover the recurring costs of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
2. Swap their own <a href="source.htm">source</a>s for the <a href="source.htm">source</a>s that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion requires.<br/>
3. Allow the group to trade a portion of their <a href="property.htm">property</a> for the <a href="source.htm">source</a>s that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion requires.<br/>
4. Secede from the group to retain their now un<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive <a href="property.htm">property</a>.<br/>
