Hey Duane, good to hear from you.<br/>
<br/>
My fascination with this subject continues;<br/>
partly because of it's apparent complexity,<br/>
and partly because of it's actual simplicity.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Summary of the problem:<br/>
Capitalism requires investors and most investors<br/>
require <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> and <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> requires scarcity, and<br/>
so Capitalism usually requires scarcity.<br/>
<br/>
Summary of the solution:<br/>
Capitalism requires investors but some investors<br/>
<small>(consumers)</small> will accept <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t, and in that case<br/>
Capitalism does not require scarcity.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am working on a simplified and more complete<br/>
explanation which I will email to you soon.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the index of that work:<br/>
<br/>
-1. <a href="crowd.htm">Crowd</a>-funding reveals what is possible.<br/>
<a href="crowd.htm">Crowd</a>-funding shows that some consumers can be<br/>
investors who will accept the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t itself as<br/>
the return on investment.<br/>
<br/>
0. Investors must become real co-owners.<br/>
This gives the consumers absolute dominion over<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and eliminates <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> naturally.<br/>
<br/>
1. <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t is the owner's natural return.<br/>
This is economic imputation and eliminates the need<br/>
to buy or sell the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t because it is already in<br/>
the hands of those who need it.<br/>
<br/>
2. <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s are the worker's investment.<br/>
This means workers will become co-owners in the<br/>
means of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion *which they need the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t*<br/>
and accept <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t as ROI, as all other owners.<br/>
This is probably the most complicated part of the<br/>
system and requires we have a <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion 'arena'<br/>
which has a wide variety of means of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion<br/>
and can be used to "Swap Skills" as the basis of<br/>
what I call a "Basic Outcome".<br/>
<br/>
3. <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is the payer's investment.<br/>
This means late-coming Consumers will overpay for<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t, just as in regular Capitalism, but we<br/>
will treat some % of that value as though they had<br/>
made an investment.&nbsp;&nbsp;This causes all consumers to<br/>
eventually become owners and therefore stop paying<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">profit</a> just as all other investors.<br/>
<br/>
4. Secession is an inalienable right.<br/>
This is a <small>(clumsy)</small> attempt to solve the tyranny of<br/>
the majority problem.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Patrick<br/>
