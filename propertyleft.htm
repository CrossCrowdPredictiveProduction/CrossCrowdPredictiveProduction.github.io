<br/>
<a href="propertyleft.htm">Propertyleft</a> is a general method for making physical <a href="property.htm">property</a> <a href="free.htm">free</a>, and requiring all modified and extended versions of that <a href="property.htm">property</a> to be <a href="free.htm">free</a> as well.<br/>
<br/>
The simplest way to make <a href="property.htm">property</a> <a href="free.htm">free</a> is to put it in a public area, unprotected.&nbsp;&nbsp;This allows people to share the <a href="property.htm">property</a> and their improvements, if they are so minded.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it also allows uncooperative people to convert that <a href="property.htm">property</a> into proprietary <a href="property.htm">property</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;They can make changes, many or few, and distribute the result as proprietary <a href="property.htm">property</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; People who receive the <a href="property.htm">property</a> in that modified form do not have the <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom that the original author gave them; the middleman has stripped it away.<br/>
<br/>
In the <a href="ccpp.htm">CCPP</a> project, our aim is to give all <a href="user.htm">user</a>s the <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom to redistribute and change <a href="ccpp.htm">CCPP</a> <a href="property.htm">property</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;If middlemen could strip off the <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom, we might have many <a href="user.htm">user</a>s, but those <a href="user.htm">user</a>s would not have <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom.&nbsp;&nbsp;So instead of putting <a href="ccpp.htm">CCPP</a> <a href="property.htm">property</a> in the public domain, we "<a href="propertyleft.htm">propertyleft</a>" it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="propertyleft.htm">Propertyleft</a> says that anyone who redistributes the <a href="property.htm">property</a>, with or without changes, must pass along the <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom to further copy and change it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="propertyleft.htm">Propertyleft</a> guarantees that every <a href="user.htm">user</a> has <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="propertyleft.htm">Propertyleft</a> also provides an incentive for other <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ers to add to <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="property.htm">property</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Important <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="property.htm">property</a> such as any <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> exists only because of this.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="propertyleft.htm">Propertyleft</a> also helps <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ers who want to contribute improvements to <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="property.htm">property</a> get permission to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;These <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ers often <a href="work.htm">work</a> for companies or universities that would do almost anything to get more <a href="money.htm">money</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;A programmer may want to contribute her changes to the community, but her employer may want to turn the changes into proprietary <a href="property.htm">property</a>.<br/>
<br/>
When we explain to the employer that it is illegal to distribute the improved version except as <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="property.htm">property</a>, the employer usually decides to release it as <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="property.htm">property</a> rather than throw it away.<br/>
<br/>
To <a href="propertyleft.htm">propertyleft</a> a program, we must first own it; then we add distribution terms, which are a legal instrument that gives everyone the rights to use, modify, and redistribute that <a href="property.htm">property</a>, or any <a href="property.htm">property</a> derived from it, but only if the distribution terms are unchanged.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the <a href="property.htm">property</a> and the <a href="free.htm">free</a>doms become legally inseparable.<br/>
<br/>
Proprietary <a href="property.htm">property</a> developers use <a href="property.htm">property</a> right to take away the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s' <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom; we use <a href="property.htm">property</a> right to guarantee their <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom.&nbsp;&nbsp;That's why we reverse the name, changing "<a href="property.htm">property</a> right" into "<a href="propertyleft.htm">propertyleft</a>".<br/>
<br/>
<a href="propertyleft.htm">Propertyleft</a> is a way of using of the <a href="property.htm">property</a> right on the program.&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn't mean abandoning the <a href="property.htm">property</a> rights; in fact, doing so would make <a href="propertyleft.htm">propertyleft</a> impossible.&nbsp;&nbsp;The "left" in "<a href="propertyleft.htm">propertyleft</a>" is not a reference to the verb "to leave" - only to the direction which is the inverse of "right".<br/>
<br/>
<a href="propertyleft.htm">Propertyleft</a> is a general concept, and you can't use a general concept directly; you can only use a specific implementation of the concept.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the <a href="ccpp.htm">CCPP</a> Project, the specific distribution terms that we use for most <a href="property.htm">property</a> are contained in the <a href="ccpp.htm">CCPP</a> Intra Owner Trade Agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="ccpp.htm">CCPP</a> Intra Owner Trade Agreement is often called the <a href="ccpp.htm">CCPP</a> <a href="iota.htm">IOTA</a> for short.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="iota.htm">IOTA</a> is designed so that you can easily apply it to your own <a href="property.htm">property</a>, assuming you are the <a href="property.htm">property</a> owner.&nbsp;&nbsp;You don't have to modify the <a href="iota.htm">IOTA</a> to do this, just post a copy on the <a href="property.htm">property</a> in an easily visible location.&nbsp;&nbsp;You might use a billboard for a large parcel of land; you might use a sticker for fruit; you might engrave the agreement on tools.<br/>
<br/>
Using the same distribution terms for many different properties makes it easy to cooperate between various different properties.&nbsp;&nbsp;When they all have the same distribution terms, there is no problem.<br/>
