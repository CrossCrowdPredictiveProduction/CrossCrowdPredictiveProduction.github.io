<p class='main'>We have been taught the baker should own the bakery.<br/>
But what about the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers that must buy that bread?<br/>
<br/>
And what if we could automate that <a href="work.htm">work</a> with robots?<br/>
Will we resist improvements to perpetuate employment?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We must look again with fresh eyes to see that every <a href="work.htm">work</a>er is also a <a href="consume.htm">consume</a>r and it is the ability to <a href="consume.htm">consume</a> that we must protect.<br/>
<br/>
We, the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers as <a href="consume.htm">consume</a>rs, will buy and co-own the farms and factories for which we need the results.<br/>
<br/>
When we own the <a href="source.htm">source</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and accept the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t itself as the return on those investments, the <a href="price.htm">price</a> we pay as <a href="consume.htm">consume</a>rs will be exactly the costs we paid as owners, and so <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> will not even exist because the usual transaction of buying/selling the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t will not occur.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers need ownership in the <a href="source.htm">source</a>s of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts they need so they have a solid footing from which they can demand a higher wage or ignore offers they consider too low.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="free.htm">Free</a> software is all about insuring <a href="consume.htm">consume</a>rs have access to <a href="source.htm">source</a>s because, under those conditions, <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers cannot subjugate the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s by withholding the <a href="free.htm">free</a>doms to use, modify, copy and share that instance or future instances.<br/>
<br/>
When <a href="consume.htm">consume</a>rs own the <a href="source.htm">source</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers cannot charge more than market <a href="price.htm">price</a> because competition between <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers is perfected since any capable <a href="work.htm">work</a>er can begin with zero barriers to entry.<br/>
<br/>
This is one part of the solution to organizing in a fundamentally different manner that increases both economic and ecologic efficiency.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Another part of the puzzle is to treat <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s to <a href="work.htm">work</a> in the future as cross-investments in the means of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion for which that person needs <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts.<br/>
<br/>
This allows us to swap skills without the usual problem of simultaneous coincidence of wants faced by traditional barter.<br/>
<br/>
When used together, these two optimizations create an imperfect insurance for any good or service we would like to guarantee and nearly eliminates the usual need for <a href="money.htm">money</a> within that society.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The next part of the puzzle is a negative-feedback loop required to keep the system stable as it scales in size.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> measures the payerâ€™s dependence upon the current owners.<br/>
<br/>
Treating <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as a reward for the current owners accumulates wealth and power.<br/>
<br/>
But treating <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as the payer's investment automatically distributes growth to those willing to pay for that growth instead of concentrating into the hands of a few originators.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The last known part of the solution is allowing subgroups to secede from the group for any reason while retaining their ownership so control remains localized even as the entity scales to cover the earth.<br/>
