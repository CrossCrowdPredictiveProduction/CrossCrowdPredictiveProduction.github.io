<p class='main'>Welcome to the <a href="cross crowd predictive production.htm">Cross Crowd Predictive Production</a> website for experimental economics.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Most people assume the bakers should own the bakery.<br/>
<br/>
But this overly simplistic position guarantees our failure as those few workers then hold that <a href="property.htm">property</a> against the people that need the results and so slowly but inevitably become another head in the beast they originally fought.<br/>
<br/>
We must look again with fresh eyes to see that every worker is also a consumer and it is the ability to consume that we must protect by organizing people to buy and co-own the farms and factories for which they need the results.<br/>
<br/>
When the consumers own the means of <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion and accept the <a href="product.htm">product</a> itself as the return on those investments, the <a href="price.htm">price</a> they pay as consumers is exactly the costs they paid as owners, and <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> does not even exist because the usual transaction of buying/selling the <a href="product.htm">product</a> does not occur.<br/>
<br/>
This is 1/3 of the solution to how we will organize in a fundamentally different manner that will allow us to operate more efficiently than the capitalists.<br/>
<br/>
The 2nd part of the puzzle is to treat <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s to work in the <a href="future.htm">future</a> as cross-investments in the means of <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion for which that person needs <a href="product.htm">product</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
This allows us to swap skills without the usual problem of simultaneous coincidence of wants faced by traditional barter.<br/>
<br/>
When used together, these two optimizations create an imperfect insurance for any <a href="good.htm">good</a> or <a href="service.htm">service</a> we would like to guarantee and nearly eliminates the usual need to pass tokens within that society.<br/>
<br/>
The 3rd part of the puzzle is a negative-feedback loop required to keep the system stable as it scales in size.<br/>
<br/>
Traditional capitalism suffers from an over-accumulation of wealth and power caused by treating <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as a reward for the current owners.<br/>
<br/>
But <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is actually a measure of the payer’s dependence upon the current owners.<br/>
<br/>
Treating <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as an investment from the payer causes ownership in the society to be automatically distributed to those willing to pay for that growth instead of concentrating into the hands of a few originators.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span>..<br/>
<br/>
We must protect the worker’s ability to consume.<br/>
<br/>
There is no need to glorify work, especially considering robots will soon be doing most of what the poorest people now do.<br/>
<br/>
Why burden the worker with the expense of ownership?<br/>
<br/>
Do you believe the worker should be able to charge more than you are willing to pay?<br/>
<br/>
If consumers have sufficient ownership in the bakery, it will do the workers no <a href="good.htm">good</a> to also have ownership because the only way the workers can charge more than the market will bear is by stopping others from competing for those jobs.<br/>
<br/>
And yet, if the consumers have sufficient ownership, they can just hire any willing worker or replace them with a machine.<br/>
<br/>
Workers need ownership in the physical sources of the <a href="product.htm">product</a>s they need to consume so they have a solid footing from which they can demand a higher wage or ignore offers they consider too low.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="free.htm">Free</a> software is all about insuring the consumers have access to the sources, and once that is achieved, the workers <small>(developers)</small> are no longer able to overcharge for the work for they do because competition between workers then perfect since any capable worker can begin with zero barriers to entry.<br/>
