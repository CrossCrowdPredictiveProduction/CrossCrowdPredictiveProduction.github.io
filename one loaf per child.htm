<a href="bread.htm">Bread</a> and software are more the same than diffe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> tend to think of software as a special <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t because it is <a href="app.htm">app</a>ears to exist in a <a href="virt.htm">virt</a>ual world of zero rivalry. But that is incorrect. While any digital <a href="info.htm">info</a>rmation can be quickly and almost effortlessly <a href="copi.htm">copi</a>ed from one <a href="phys.htm">phys</a>ical <a href="mediu.htm">mediu</a>m to another, the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s to store and express it are not even close to zero. One of the largest <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s is the <a href="comp.htm">comp</a>uter itself.<br/>
<br/>
The genetics of wheat, the de<a href="sign.htm">sign</a>s of the <a href="tool.htm">tool</a>s and the <a href="plan.htm">plan</a> or <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ructions <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to <a href="plant.htm">plant</a>, har<a href="vest.htm">vest</a>, grind, mix and bake are the <a href="virt.htm">virt</a>ual <a href="part.htm">part</a>s of <a href="bread.htm">bread</a>. The <a href="phys.htm">phys</a>ical <a href="part.htm">part</a>s are the <a href="act.htm">act</a>ual <a href="seed.htm">seed</a>s <small>(the mass which contains that <a href="data.htm">data</a> called DNA)</small>, <a href="land.htm">land</a> <small>(surface <a href="area.htm">area</a> of the earth)</small>, soil <small>(<a href="bot.htm">bot</a>h minerals and <a href="rot.htm">rot</a>ting <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nic <a href="matt.htm">matt</a>er)</small>, <a href="water.htm">water</a>, energy <small>(including the <a href="sun.htm">SUN</a>)</small>, petrol for plastics and <a href="meta.htm">meta</a>ls <small>(and recursively the <a href="virt.htm">virt</a>ual and <a href="phys.htm">phys</a>ical <a href="part.htm">part</a>s of the <a href="machin.htm">machin</a>es <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to extract these from the earth and <a href="form.htm">form</a> them)</small>, etc.<br/>
<br/>
A <a href="comp.htm">comp</a>uter also <a href="need.htm">need</a>s <a href="land.htm">land</a> <small>(rackspace – which also implies a building)</small>, energy <small>(electri<a href="city.htm">city</a>)</small>, plastic and <a href="meta.htm">meta</a>ls; plus the <a href="virt.htm">virt</a>ual de<a href="sign.htm">sign</a>s <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed to assemble those raw <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ials into motherboards, CPU, RAM, Hard Drive, Optical <a href="media.htm">Media</a> read/writer, fans, screws, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Moglen claims it would be evil to not <a href="give.htm">give</a> <a href="bread.htm">bread</a> away if it were as <a href="cheap.htm">cheap</a> to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e, yet, if <a href="we.htm">we</a> step through the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion <a href="we.htm">we</a> find the <a href="phys.htm">phys</a>ical resouces <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed to host the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion of <a href="bread.htm">bread</a> are much smaller than those <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed to host <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ances of software.<br/>
<br/>
When he says no<a href="body.htm">body</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>s <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software he is <a href="refer.htm">refer</a>ring to the <a href="virt.htm">virt</a>ual <a href="part.htm">part</a>, but when it comes to the <a href="phys.htm">phys</a>ical <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ial required to host <small>(store and express)</small> that software, it is primarily the end-<a href="user.htm">user</a>s that <a href="own.htm">own</a>. OLPC was <a href="star.htm">star</a>ted to address that very issue for those that don’t have a <a href="home.htm">home</a> <a href="machin.htm">machin</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
So for <a href="comp.htm">comp</a>uting the problem is hidden in plain sight – in that <a href="we.htm">we</a> overlook those <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s maybe because <a href="we.htm">we</a> have the attitude “well, I would have bought the <a href="comp.htm">comp</a>uter either way”. But that same reasoning could be <a href="app.htm">app</a>lied to your yard. If you <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="land.htm">land</a> that is not covered by asphalt, concrete or continually poisoned with weed killer then it will probably be <a href="grow.htm">grow</a>ing some<a href="thing.htm">thing</a>, and that some<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> very well could be the extremely easy to <a href="grow.htm">grow</a> grass called Wheat. You could <a href="grow.htm">grow</a> <a href="enough.htm">enough</a> in 1 square foot to <a href="make.htm">make</a> a loaf, but most people don’t because it is too clumsy, but even if <a href="we.htm">we</a> limit <a href="our.htm">our</a>selves to the small-scale <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion where <a href="phys.htm">phys</a>ical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es are only individually <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed <small>(such as Mao’s back-yard steel furnaces)</small> the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> is still less than software. The simple <a href="hand.htm">hand</a> <a href="tool.htm">tool</a>s required over the entire <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion of <a href="bread.htm">bread</a> are very rudimentary and orders of magnitude less <a href="comp.htm">comp</a>lex than the electronics required to store and express software.<br/>
<br/>
But this is even easier to prove for large scale, <a href="corp.htm">corp</a>orate <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture where the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s are so small that the <a href="us.htm">US</a> <a href="gov.htm">gov</a>ernment <a href="act.htm">act</a>ually <a href="pay.htm">PAY</a>S <a href="farm.htm">farm</a>ers to NOT <a href="grow.htm">grow</a> wheat. They <small>(the supposed “<a href="we.htm">we</a>”)</small> <a href="use.htm">use</a> federal <a href="tax.htm">tax</a> dollars to keep wheat <small>(and therefore <a href="bread.htm">bread</a>)</small> artificially expensive so that <a href="price.htm">price</a> does not reach <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>. This also causes <a href="us.htm">US</a> to ‘dump’ this <a href="food.htm">food</a> in foreign countries for <a href="price.htm">price</a>s less than what the local <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>er can <a href="charg.htm">charg</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
You may think “It’s not <a href="our.htm">our</a> fault, why don’t they just <a href="grow.htm">grow</a> their <a href="own.htm">own</a> damn <a href="food.htm">food</a>?”. But the trouble there is <a href="our.htm">our</a> universal misconception of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as goal <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ead of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion. So, while a small <a href="farm.htm">farm</a>er who <a href="own.htm">own</a>s the <a href="phys.htm">phys</a>ical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion can <a href="grow.htm">grow</a> some wheat for himself, once he begins <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ing with neighbors he <a href="must.htm">must</a> take a stance AGA<a href="inst.htm">INST</a> them because <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of those <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es do not ‘flow’ to the <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>ers of the <a href="object.htm">object</a>s of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
This is the same lack of <a href="control.htm">control</a> <a href="we.htm">we</a> <a href="see.htm">see</a> and are beginning to <a href="comp.htm">comp</a>lain about with SaaS hosts such as MySpace, Feedburner, Google, etc. and all other in<a href="dust.htm">dust</a>ry like <a href="cell.htm">cell</a>-<a href="phon.htm">phon</a>e ‘<a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ice’, gasoline <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ers, DRM laden electronics, etc. who offer deals that <a href="app.htm">app</a>ear to be “<a href="good.htm">good</a> <a href="enough.htm">enough</a>”, but can pull the rug out whenever they please and can <a href="charg.htm">charg</a>e <a href="price.htm">price</a>s far above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>, as they are the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
This is the core issue of what is wrong with the structure of <a href="our.htm">our</a> <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy. <a href="price.htm">Price</a>s <a href="must.htm">must</a> be “<a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ed” from reaching <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> because businesses define their success by the <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> they extract, not by <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion itself.<br/>
<br/>
Confusingly, the <a href="word.htm">word</a> “<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>er” some<a href="time.htm">time</a>s de<a href="note.htm">note</a>s the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers, and some<a href="time.htm">time</a>s de<a href="note.htm">note</a>s the <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers. For a small business where the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er is also a <a href="work.htm">work</a>er the line is even more blurry. <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers receive <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>s, and are not generally involved with <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>, while <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers usually in<a href="vest.htm">vest</a> for the long <a href="term.htm">term</a> goal of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>. This is a <a href="pre.htm">pre</a>carious situation that destroys small business that <a href="play.htm">play</a> that <a href="game.htm">game</a>, since efficiency in scale causes only the largest <a href="corp.htm">corp</a>orations to survive. This is why <a href="we.htm">we</a> <a href="see.htm">see</a> fewer and fewer <a href="farm.htm">farm</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers and <a href="our.htm">our</a> <a href="food.htm">food</a> supply being <a href="control.htm">control</a>led by a <a href="hand.htm">hand</a>ful of <a href="pow.htm">pow</a>erful <a href="corp.htm">corp</a>orations that barely <a href="need.htm">need</a> answer to <a href="our.htm">our</a> supposed <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>er ‘demands’.<br/>
<br/>
But there is a special case where <a href="price.htm">price</a> can reach <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> – where <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and <a href="abund.htm">abund</a>ance is always <a href="good.htm">good</a> and <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is <a href="act.htm">act</a>ually meaningless. This condition occurs when the <a href="object.htm">Object</a> <a href="user.htm">User</a>s <small>(<a href="consum.htm">consum</a>ers)</small> also happen to be the very <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers of the <a href="phys.htm">phys</a>ical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es <small>(<a href="means.htm">Means</a> of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
When you <a href="own.htm">OWN</a> the <a href="land.htm">land</a>, <a href="water.htm">water</a>, <a href="seed.htm">seed</a>, tractor, thresher, grinder, mixer, stove, pans, buildings <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed to <a href="make.htm">make</a> <a href="bread.htm">bread</a> you may hire someone to operate those <a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s <small>(and would <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> that <a href="wage.htm">wage</a> as a <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>)</small>, but you can’t <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="price.htm">price</a> above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> unless you were to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> it to yourself. It doesn’t <a href="make.htm">make</a> sense in that case; <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is undefined when the <a href="object.htm">Object</a> <a href="consum.htm">Consum</a>er is the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er.<br/>
<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ing the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion is easy when the operation is small and you don’t <a href="need.htm">need</a> to <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e, but in many cases it is more efficient or even mandatory that the <a href="phys.htm">phys</a>ical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es be <a href="join.htm">join</a>tly <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed because each <a href="person.htm">person</a> just can’t afford <small>(and it would be terribly wastful)</small> to <a href="own.htm">Own</a> the <a href="land.htm">land</a>, buildings, <a href="tool.htm">tool</a>s, etc. to <a href="make.htm">make</a> <small>(for <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ance)</small> laptops – <a href="we.htm">we</a> tend to leave that to a random <a href="group.htm">group</a> of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers that intend to keep <a href="price.htm">price</a> above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The argument aga<a href="inst.htm">inst</a> addressing this issue usually revolves around the <a href="idea.htm">idea</a> “Well, who in the world would in<a href="vest.htm">vest</a> if there will be no <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>?”. The surprising answer is: *The <a href="consum.htm">Consum</a>er* will in<a href="vest.htm">vest</a>, since <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion is already their only motive.<br/>
<br/>
So now the question of how to <a href="make.htm">make</a> this occur without coercion – since any other way would be not only unfair, but, as Moglen <a href="state.htm">state</a>s, would not have <a href="enough.htm">enough</a> momentum to continue anyway.<br/>
<br/>
A <a href="solu.htm">solu</a>tion patterned after the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> General <a href="public.htm">Public</a> License <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment would be some kind of <a href="contract.htm">contract</a> that <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers could CHOOSE to <a href="app.htm">app</a>ly to <a href="phys.htm">phys</a>ical <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty. That <a href="contract.htm">contract</a> might say some<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> to the effect of:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">:</span> If you <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e this <a href="object.htm">object</a> <small>(say an <a href="app.htm">app</a>le)</small>, you <a href="must.htm">must</a> en<a href="sure.htm">sure</a> the end <a href="user.htm">user</a> <small>(the <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>er)</small> has access to the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of that <a href="object.htm">object</a> <small>(the <a href="land.htm">land</a>, <a href="water.htm">water</a>, trees, <a href="tool.htm">tool</a>s)</small>. One way to ac<a href="comp.htm">comp</a>lish this is through a revenue <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>ing scheme that causes any amount <a href="paid.htm">paid</a> above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s <small>(what would usually be called <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small> to become an in<a href="vest.htm">vest</a>ment in the <a href="name.htm">name</a> of that <a href="user.htm">User</a> toward the <a href="purch.htm">purch</a>ase of more <a href="phys.htm">phys</a>ical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es required for <a href="future.htm">future</a> <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion of that same <a href="object.htm">object</a>.<br/>
