Chapter I<br/>
<br/>
Had! The manifestation of Nuit.<br/>
<br/>
The unveiling of the company of heaven.<br/>
<br/>
Every man and every woman is a <a href="star.htm">star</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Every number is infinite; there is no difference.<br/>
<br/>
Help me, o warrior lord of Thebes, in my unveiling before the Children of men!<br/>
<br/>
Be thou Hadit, my secret centre, my heart &amp; my tongue!<br/>
<br/>
Be<a href="hold.htm">hold</a>! it is revealed by Aiwass the minister of Hoor-paar-kraat.<br/>
<br/>
The Khabs is in the Khu, not the Khu in the Khabs.<br/>
<br/>
Worship then the Khabs, and be<a href="hold.htm">hold</a> my light shed over you!<br/>
<br/>
Let my <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ants be few &amp; secret: they shall rule the many &amp; the known.<br/>
<br/>
These are fools that men adore; <a href="bot.htm">bot</a>h their <a href="god.htm">God</a>s &amp; their men are fools.<br/>
<br/>
Come forth, o children, under the <a href="star.htm">star</a>s, &amp; take your fill of love!<br/>
<br/>
I am above you and in you. My ecstasy is in yours. My joy is to see your joy.<br/>
<br/>
Above, the gemmed azure is<br/>
The naked splendour of Nuit;<br/>
She bends in ecstasy to kiss<br/>
The secret ardours of Hadit.<br/>
The <a href="win.htm">win</a>ged globe, the <a href="star.htm">star</a>ry blue,<br/>
Are mine, O Ankh-af-na-khonsu!<br/>
Now ye shall know that the chosen priest &amp; apostle of infinite space is the prince-priest the Beast; and in his woman called the Scarlet Woman is all power given. They shall <a href="gath.htm">gath</a>er my children into their fold: they shall bring the glory of the <a href="star.htm">star</a>s into the hearts of men.<br/>
<br/>
For he is ever a <a href="sun.htm">sun</a>, and she a moon. But to him is the <a href="win.htm">win</a>ged secret flame, and to her the stooping <a href="star.htm">star</a>light.<br/>
<br/>
But ye are not so chosen.<br/>
<br/>
Burn upon their brows, o splendrous serpent!<br/>
<br/>
O azure-lidded woman, bend upon them!<br/>
<br/>
The key of the rituals is in the secret <a href="word.htm">word</a> which I have given unto him.<br/>
<br/>
With the <a href="god.htm">God</a> &amp; the Adorer I am no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a>: they do not see me. They are as upon the earth; I am Heaven, and there is no other <a href="god.htm">God</a> than me, and my lord Hadit.<br/>
<br/>
Now, therefore, I am known to ye by my <a href="name.htm">name</a> Nuit, and to him by a secret <a href="name.htm">name</a> which I will give him when at last he knoweth me. Since I am Infinite Space, and the Infinite <a href="star.htm">Star</a>s thereof, do ye also thus. Bind no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a>! Let there be no difference made among you between any one <a href="thing.htm">thing</a> &amp; any other <a href="thing.htm">thing</a>; for thereby there cometh hurt.<br/>
<br/>
But whoso availeth in this, let him be the chief of all!<br/>
<br/>
I am Nuit, and my <a href="word.htm">word</a> is six and fifty.<br/>
<br/>
Divide, add, multiply, and understand.<br/>
<br/>
Then saith the prophet and slave of the beauteous one: Who am I, and what shall be the sign? So she answered him, bendingdown, a lambent flame of blue, all-touching, all penetrant, her lovely hands upon the black earth, &amp; her lithe body arched for love, and her soft feet not hurting the little flowers: Thou knowest! And the sign shall be my ecstasy, the consciousness of the continuity of existence, the omnipresence of my body.<br/>
<br/>
Then the priest answered &amp; said unto the Queen of Space, kissing her lovely brows, and the dew of her light ba<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> his whole body in a sweet-smelling perfume of sweat: O Nuit, continuous one of Heaven, let it be ever thus; that men speak not of Thee as One but as None; and let them speak not of thee at all, since thou art continuous!<br/>
<br/>
None, breathed the light, faint &amp; faery, of the <a href="star.htm">star</a>s, and two.<br/>
<br/>
For I am divided for love's sake, for the chance of union.<br/>
<br/>
This is the <a href="creat.htm">creat</a>ion of the world, that the pain of division is as no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a>, and the joy of dis<a href="solu.htm">solu</a>tion all.<br/>
<br/>
For these fools of men and their woes care not thou at all! They feel little; what is, is balanced by weak joys; but ye are my chosen ones.<br/>
<br/>
Obey my prophet! follow out the ordeals of my knowledge! seek me only! Then the joys of my love will redeem ye from all pain. This is so: I swear it by the vault of my body; by my sacred heart and tongue; by all I can give, by all I desire of ye all.<br/>
<br/>
Then the priest fell into a deep trance or swoon, &amp; said unto the Queen of Heaven; Write unto <a href="us.htm">us</a> the ordeals; write unto <a href="us.htm">us</a> the rituals; write unto <a href="us.htm">us</a> the <a href="law.htm">law</a>!<br/>
<br/>
But she said: the ordeals I write not: the rituals shall be half known and half concealed: the <a href="law.htm">Law</a> is for all.<br/>
<br/>
This that thou writest is the threefold book of <a href="law.htm">Law</a>.<br/>
<br/>
My scribe Ankh-af-na-khonsu, the priest of the princes, shall not in one letter <a href="chang.htm">chang</a>e this book; but lest there be folly, he shall comment thereupon by the wisdom of Ra-Hoor-Khuit.<br/>
<br/>
Also the mantras and <a href="spell.htm">spell</a>s; the obeah and the wanga; the <a href="work.htm">work</a> of the wand and the <a href="work.htm">work</a> of the s<a href="word.htm">word</a>; these he shall learn and teach.<br/>
<br/>
He <a href="must.htm">must</a> teach; but he may <a href="make.htm">make</a> severe the ordeals.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="word.htm">word</a> of the <a href="law.htm">Law</a> is THELEMA.<br/>
<br/>
Who calls <a href="us.htm">us</a> Thelemites will do no wrong, if he look but close into the <a href="word.htm">word</a>. For there are therein Three Grades, the Hermit, and the Lover, and the man of Earth. Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the <a href="law.htm">Law</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="word.htm">word</a> of Sin is Restriction. O man! refuse not thy wife, if she will! O lover, if thou wilt, depart! There is no bond that can unite the divided but love: all else is a <a href="cur.htm">cur</a>se. Accursed! Accursed be it to the aeons! Hell.<br/>
<br/>
Let it be that state of manyhood bound and loa<a href="thing.htm">thing</a>. So with thy all; thou hast no right but to do thy will.<br/>
<br/>
Do that, and no other shall say nay.<br/>
<br/>
For pure will, unassuaged of purpose, delivered from the lust of result, is every way perfect.<br/>
<br/>
The Perfect and the Perfect are one Perfect and not two; nay, are none!<br/>
<br/>
No<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> is a secret key of this <a href="law.htm">law</a>. Sixty-one the Jews call it; I call it eight, eighty, four hundred &amp; eighteen.<br/>
<br/>
But they have the half: unite by thine art so that all disappear.<br/>
<br/>
My prophet is a fool with his one, one, one; are not they the Ox, and none by the Book?<br/>
<br/>
Abrogate are all rituals, all ordeals, all <a href="word.htm">word</a>s and signs. Ra-Hoor-Khuit hath taken his seat in the East at the Equinox of the <a href="god.htm">God</a>s; and let Asar be with Isa, who also are one. But they are not of me. Let Asar be the adorant, Isa the sufferer; Hoor in his secret <a href="name.htm">name</a> and splendour is the Lord initiating.<br/>
<br/>
There is a <a href="word.htm">word</a> to say about the Hierophantic task. Be<a href="hold.htm">hold</a>! there are three ordeals in one, and it may be given in three ways. The gross <a href="must.htm">must</a> <a href="pass.htm">pass</a> through fire; let the fine be tried in intellect, and the lofty chosen ones in the highest. Thus ye have <a href="star.htm">star</a> &amp; <a href="star.htm">star</a>, system &amp; system; let not one know well the other!<br/>
<br/>
There are four gates to one palace; the floor of that palace is of silver and <a href="gold.htm">gold</a>; lapis lazuli &amp; jasper are there; and all rare scents; jasmine &amp; rose, and the emblems of death. Let him enter in turn or at once the four gates; let him stand on the floor of the palace. Will he not sink? Amn. Ho! warrior, if thy <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ant sink? But there are <a href="means.htm">means</a> and <a href="means.htm">means</a>. Be <a href="good.htm">good</a>ly therefore: dress ye all in fine apparel; <a href="eat.htm">eat</a> rich <a href="food.htm">food</a>s and <a href="drink.htm">drink</a> sweet <a href="win.htm">win</a>es and <a href="win.htm">win</a>es that foam! Also, take your fill and will of love as ye will, when, where and with whom ye will! But always unto me.<br/>
<br/>
If this be not aright; if ye confound the space-marks, saying: They are one; or saying, They are many; if the ritual be not ever unto me: then expect the direful judgments of Ra Hoor Khuit!<br/>
<br/>
This shall regenerate the world, the little world my sister, my heart &amp; my tongue, unto whom I send this kiss. Also, o scribe and prophet, though thou be of the princes, it shall not assuage thee nor ab<a href="solv.htm">solv</a>e thee. But ecstasy be thine and joy of earth: ever To me! To me!<br/>
<br/>
<a href="chang.htm">Chang</a>e not as much as the style of a letter; for be<a href="hold.htm">hold</a>! thou, o prophet, shalt not be<a href="hold.htm">hold</a> all these mysteries hidden therein.<br/>
<br/>
The child of thy bowels, he shall be<a href="hold.htm">hold</a> them.<br/>
<br/>
Expect him not from the East, nor from the West; for from no expected house cometh that child. Aum! All <a href="word.htm">word</a>s are sacred and all prophets true; save only that they understand a little; <a href="solv.htm">solv</a>e the first half of the equation, leave the s<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>d unattacked. But thou hast all in the clear light, and some, though not all, in the dark.<br/>
<br/>
Invoke me under my <a href="star.htm">star</a>s! Love is the <a href="law.htm">law</a>, love under will. Nor let the fools mistake love; for there are love and love. There is the dove, and there is the serpent. Choose ye well! He, my prophet, hath chosen, knowing the <a href="law.htm">law</a> of the fortress, and the great mystery of the House of <a href="god.htm">God</a>.<br/>
<br/>
All these <a href="old.htm">old</a> letters of my Book are aright; but <small>[Tzaddi]</small> is not the <a href="star.htm">Star</a>. This also is secret: my prophet shall reveal it to the wise.<br/>
<br/>
I give unimaginable joys on earth: certainty, not faith, while in life, upon death; peace unutterable, rest, ecstasy; nor do I demand aught in sacrifice.<br/>
<br/>
My incense is of resinous woods &amp; gums; and there is no blood therein: because of my hair the trees of Eternity.<br/>
<br/>
My number is 11, as all their numbers who are of <a href="us.htm">us</a>. The Five <a href="point.htm">Point</a>ed <a href="star.htm">Star</a>, with a Circle in the Middle, &amp; the circle is Red. My colour is black to the blind, but the blue &amp; <a href="gold.htm">gold</a> are seen of the seeing. Also I have asecret glory for them that love me.<br/>
<br/>
But to love me is better than all <a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s: if under the night <a href="star.htm">star</a>s in the desert thou presently burnest mine incense before me, invoking me with a pure heart, and the Serpent flame therein, thou shalt come a little to lie in my bosom. For one kiss wilt thou then be willing to give all; but whoso gives one particle of dust shall lose all in that hour. Ye shall <a href="gath.htm">gath</a>er <a href="good.htm">good</a>s and store of women and spices; ye shall wear rich jewels; ye shall exceed the nations of the earth in splendour &amp; pride; but always in the love of me, and so shall ye come to my joy. I <a href="charg.htm">charg</a>e you earnestly to come before me in a single robe, and covered with a rich headdress. I love you! I yearn to you! Pale or purple, veiled or voluptuous, I who am all pleasure and purple, and drunkenness of the innermost sense, desire you. Put on the <a href="win.htm">win</a>gs, and arouse the coiled splendour within you: come unto me!<br/>
<br/>
At all my meetings with you shall the priestess say -- and her eyes shall burn with desire as she stands bare and rejoicing in my secret temple -- To me! To me! calling forth the flame of the hearts of all in her love-chant.<br/>
<br/>
Sing the rapturous love-song unto me! Burn to me perfumes! Wear to me jewels! <a href="drink.htm">Drink</a> to me, for I love you! I love you!<br/>
<br/>
I am the blue-lidded daughter of <a href="sun.htm">Sun</a>set; I am the naked brilliance of the voluptuous night-sky.<br/>
<br/>
To me! To me!<br/>
<br/>
The Manifestation of Nuit is at an end.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Chapter II<br/>
<br/>
Nu! the hiding of Hadit.<br/>
<br/>
Come! all ye, and learn the secret that hath not yet been revealed. I, Hadit, am the complement of Nu, my bride. I am not extended, and Khabs is the <a href="name.htm">name</a> of my House.<br/>
<br/>
In the sphere I am everywhere the centre, as she, the circumference, is nowhere found.<br/>
<br/>
Yet she shall be known &amp; I never.<br/>
<br/>
Be<a href="hold.htm">hold</a>! the rituals of the <a href="old.htm">old</a> <a href="time.htm">time</a> are black. Let the evil ones be cast away; let the <a href="good.htm">good</a> ones be purged by the prophet! Then shall this Knowledge go aright.<br/>
<br/>
I am the flame that burns in every heart of man, and in the core of every <a href="star.htm">star</a>. I am Life, and the giver of Life, yet therefore is theknowledge of me the knowledge of death.<br/>
<br/>
I am the <a href="magic.htm">Magic</a>ian and the Exorcist. I am the axle of the wheel, and the cube in the circle. "Come unto me" is a foolish <a href="word.htm">word</a>: for it is I that go.<br/>
<br/>
Who worshipped Heru-pa-kraath have worshipped me; ill, for I am the worshipper.<br/>
<br/>
Remember all ye that existence is pure joy; that all the sorrows are but as shadows; they <a href="pass.htm">pass</a> &amp; are done; but there is that which remains.<br/>
<br/>
O prophet! thou hast ill will to learn this writing.<br/>
<br/>
I see thee hate the hand &amp; the pen; but I am stronger.<br/>
<br/>
Because of me in Thee which thou knewest not.<br/>
<br/>
for why? Because thou wast the knower, and me.<br/>
<br/>
Now let there be a veiling of this shrine: now let the light <a href="dev.htm">dev</a><a href="our.htm">our</a> men and <a href="eat.htm">eat</a> them up with blindness!<br/>
<br/>
For I am perfect, being Not; and my number is nine by the fools; but with the just I am eight, and one in eight: Which is vital, for I am none indeed. The Empress and the King are not of me; for there is a further secret.<br/>
<br/>
I am The Empress &amp; the Hierophant. Thus eleven, as my bride is eleven.<br/>
<br/>
Hear me, ye people of sighing!<br/>
The sorrows of pain and regret<br/>
Are left to the dead and the dying,<br/>
The folk that not know me as yet.<br/>
These are dead, these fellows; they feel not. <a href="we.htm">We</a> are not for the poor and sad: the lords of the earth are <a href="our.htm">our</a> kinsfolk.<br/>
<br/>
Is a <a href="god.htm">God</a> to live in a dog? No! but the highest are of <a href="us.htm">us</a>. They shall rejoice, <a href="our.htm">our</a> chosen: who sorroweth is not of <a href="us.htm">us</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Beauty and strength, leaping laughter and delicious <a href="lang.htm">lang</a>uor, force and fire, are of <a href="us.htm">us</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="we.htm">We</a> have no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> with the outcast and the unfit: let them die in their misery. For they feel not. Com<a href="pass.htm">pass</a>ion is the vice of kings: stamp down the wretched &amp; the weak: this is the <a href="law.htm">law</a> of the strong: this is <a href="our.htm">our</a> <a href="law.htm">law</a> and the joy of the world. Think not, o king, upon that lie: That Thou <a href="must.htm">Must</a> Die: verily thou shalt not die, but live. Now let it be understood: If the body of the King dis<a href="solv.htm">solv</a>e, he shall remain in pure ecstasy for ever. Nuit! Hadit! Ra-Hoor-Khuit! The <a href="sun.htm">Sun</a>, Strength &amp; Sight, Light; these are for the <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ants of the <a href="star.htm">Star</a> &amp; the Snake.<br/>
<br/>
I am the Snake that giveth Knowledge &amp; Delight and bright glory, and stir the hearts of men with drunkenness. To worship me take <a href="win.htm">win</a>e and strange <a href="drug.htm">drug</a>s whereof I will tell my prophet, &amp; be drunk thereof! They shall not harm ye at all. It is a lie, this folly aga<a href="inst.htm">inst</a> self. The exposure of innocence is a lie. Be strong, o man! lust, enjoy all <a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s of sense and rapture: fear not that any <a href="god.htm">God</a> shall deny thee for this.<br/>
<br/>
I am alone: there is no <a href="god.htm">God</a> where I am.<br/>
<br/>
Be<a href="hold.htm">hold</a>! these be grave mysteries; for there are also of my friends who be hermits. Now think not to find them in the forest or on the mountain; but in beds of purple, caressed by magnificent beasts of women with large limbs, and fire and light in their eyes, and masses of flaming hair about them; there shall ye find them. Ye shall see them at rule, at victorious armies, at all the joy; and there shall be in them a joy a million <a href="time.htm">time</a>s greater than this. Beware lest any force another, King aga<a href="inst.htm">inst</a> King! Love one another with burning hearts; on the low men trample in the fierce lust of your pride, in the day of your wrath.<br/>
<br/>
Ye are aga<a href="inst.htm">inst</a> the people, O my chosen!<br/>
<br/>
I am the secret Serpent coiled about to spring: in my coiling there is joy. If I lift up my head, I and my Nuit are one. If I droop down mine head, and shoot forth venom, then is rapture of the earth, and I and the earth are one.<br/>
<br/>
There is great danger in me; for who doth not understand these runes shall <a href="make.htm">make</a> a great miss. He shall fall down into the pit called Because, and there he shall perish with the dogs of Reason.<br/>
<br/>
Now a <a href="cur.htm">cur</a>se upon Because and his kin!<br/>
<br/>
May Because be accursed for ever!<br/>
<br/>
If Will stops and cries Why, invoking Because, then Will stops &amp; does nought.<br/>
<br/>
If Power asks why, then is Power weakness.<br/>
<br/>
Also reason is a lie; for there is a <a href="factor.htm">factor</a> infinite &amp; unknown; &amp; all their <a href="word.htm">word</a>s are skew-wise.<br/>
<br/>
Enough of Because! Be he damned for a dog!<br/>
<br/>
But ye, o my people, rise up &amp; awake!<br/>
<br/>
Let the rituals be rightly performed with joy &amp; beauty!<br/>
<br/>
There are rituals of the elements and feasts of the <a href="time.htm">time</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
A feast for the first night of the Prophet and his Bride!<br/>
<br/>
A feast for the three days of the writing of the Book of the <a href="law.htm">Law</a>.<br/>
<br/>
A feast for Tahuti and the child of the Prophet--secret, O Prophet!<br/>
<br/>
A feast for the Supreme Ritual, and a feast for the Equinox of the <a href="god.htm">God</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
A feast for fire and a feast for <a href="water.htm">water</a>; a feast for life and a greater feast for death!<br/>
<br/>
A feast every day in your hearts in the joy of my rapture!<br/>
<br/>
A feast every night unto Nu, and the pleasure of ut<a href="term.htm">term</a>ost delight!<br/>
<br/>
Aye! feast! rejoice! there is no dread hereafter. There is the dis<a href="solu.htm">solu</a>tion, and eternal ecstasy in the kisses of Nu.<br/>
<br/>
There is death for the dogs.<br/>
<br/>
Dost thou fail? Art thou sorry? Is fear in thine heart?<br/>
<br/>
Where I am these are not.<br/>
<br/>
Pity not the fallen! I never knew them. I am not for them. I console not: I hate the consoled &amp; the consoler.<br/>
<br/>
I am unique &amp; conqueror. I am not of the slaves that perish. Be they damned &amp; dead! Amen. <small>(This is of the 4: there is a fifth who is invisible, &amp; therein am I as a babe in an egg. )</small><br/>
<br/>
Blue am I and <a href="gold.htm">gold</a> in the light of my bride: but the red gleam is in my eyes; &amp; my spangles are purple &amp; green.<br/>
<br/>
Purple beyond purple: it is the light higher than eyesight.<br/>
<br/>
There is a veil: that veil is black. It is the veil of the <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>est woman; it is the veil of sorrow, &amp; the pall of death: this is none of me. Tear down that lying spectre of the centuries: veil not your vices in <a href="virt.htm">virt</a>uous <a href="word.htm">word</a>s: these vices are my <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ice; ye do well, &amp; I will reward you here and hereafter.<br/>
<br/>
Fear not, o prophet, when these <a href="word.htm">word</a>s are said, thou shalt not be sorry. Thou art emphatically my chosen; and blessed are the eyes that thou shalt look upon with gladness. But I will hide thee in a mask of sorrow: they that see thee shall fear thou art fallen: but I lift thee up.<br/>
<br/>
Nor shall they who cry aloud their folly that thou meanest nought avail; thou shall reveal it: thou availest: they are the slaves of because: They are not of me. The stops as thou wilt; the letters? <a href="chang.htm">chang</a>e them not in style or <a href="valu.htm">valu</a>e!<br/>
<br/>
Thou shalt obtain the order &amp; <a href="valu.htm">valu</a>e of the English Alphabet; thou shalt find <a href="new.htm">new</a> symbols to attribute them unto.<br/>
<br/>
Begone! ye mockers; even though ye laugh in my honour ye shall laugh not long: then when ye are sad know that I have forsaken you.<br/>
<br/>
He that is righteous shall be righteous still; he that is filthy shall be filthy still.<br/>
<br/>
Yea! deem not of <a href="chang.htm">chang</a>e: ye shall be as ye are, &amp; not other. Therefore the kings of the earth shall be Kings for ever: the slaves shall <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>e. There is none that shall be cast down or lifted up: all is ever as it was. Yet there are masked ones my <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ants: it may be that yonder beggar is a King. A King may choose his garment as he will: there is no certain test: but a beggar cannot hide his po<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>y.<br/>
<br/>
Beware therefore! Love all, lest perchance is a King concealed! Say you so? Fool! If he be a King, thou canst not hurt him.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore strike hard &amp; low, and to hell with them, master!<br/>
<br/>
There is a light before thine eyes, o prophet, a light undesired, most desirable.<br/>
<br/>
I am uplifted in thine heart; and the kisses of the <a href="star.htm">star</a>s rain hard upon thy body.<br/>
<br/>
Thou art exhaust in the voluptuous fullness of the inspiration; the expiration is sweeter than death, more rapid and laughterful than a caress of Hell's <a href="own.htm">own</a> worm.<br/>
<br/>
Oh! thou art overcome: <a href="we.htm">we</a> are upon thee; <a href="our.htm">our</a> delight is all over thee: hail! hail: prophet of Nu! prophet of Had! prophet of Ra-Hoor-Khu! Now rejoice! now come in <a href="our.htm">our</a> splendour &amp; rapture! Come in <a href="our.htm">our</a> <a href="pass.htm">pass</a>ionate peace, &amp; write sweet <a href="word.htm">word</a>s for the Kings.<br/>
<br/>
I am the Master: thou art the Holy Chosen One.<br/>
<br/>
Write, &amp; find ecstasy in writing! <a href="work.htm">Work</a>, &amp; be <a href="our.htm">our</a> bed in <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing! Thrill with the joy of life &amp; death! Ah! thy death shall be lovely: whososeeth it shall be glad. Thy death shall be the seal of the <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>e of <a href="our.htm">our</a> age long love. Come! lift up thine heart &amp; rejoice! <a href="we.htm">We</a> are one; <a href="we.htm">we</a> are none.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="hold.htm">Hold</a>! <a href="hold.htm">Hold</a>! Bear up in thy rapture; fall not in swoon of the ex<a href="cell.htm">cell</a>ent kisses!<br/>
<br/>
Harder! <a href="hold.htm">Hold</a> up thyself! Lift thine head! breathe not so deep -- die!<br/>
<br/>
Ah! Ah! What do I feel? Is the <a href="word.htm">word</a> exhausted?<br/>
<br/>
There is help &amp; hope in other <a href="spell.htm">spell</a>s. Wisdom says: be strong! Then canst thou bear more joy. Be not <a href="animal.htm">animal</a>; refine thy rapture! If thou <a href="drink.htm">drink</a>, <a href="drink.htm">drink</a> by the eight and ninety rules of art: if thou love, exceed by delicacy; and if thou do aught joyous, let there be subtlety therein!<br/>
<br/>
But exceed! exceed!<br/>
<br/>
Strive ever to more! and if thou art truly mine -- and doubt it not, an if thou art ever joyous! -- death is the crown of all.<br/>
<br/>
Ah! Ah! Death! Death! thou shalt long for death. Death is forbidden, o man, unto thee.<br/>
<br/>
The length of thy longing shall be the strength of its glory. He that lives long &amp; desires death much is ever the King among the Kings.<br/>
<br/>
Aye! listen to the numbers &amp; the <a href="word.htm">word</a>s:<br/>
<br/>
4 6 3 8 A B K 2 4 A L G M O R 3 Y X 24 89 R P S T O V A L. What meaneth this, o prophet? Thou knowest not; nor shalt thou know ever. There cometh one to follow thee: he shall expound it. But remember, o chose none, to be me; to follow the love of Nu in the <a href="star.htm">star</a>-lit heaven; to look forth upon men, to tell them this glad <a href="word.htm">word</a>.<br/>
<br/>
O be thou proud and mighty among men!<br/>
<br/>
Lift up thyself! for there is none like unto thee among men or among <a href="god.htm">God</a>s! Lift up thyself, o my prophet, thy stature shall sur<a href="pass.htm">pass</a> the <a href="star.htm">star</a>s. They shall worship thy <a href="name.htm">name</a>, foursquare, mystic, wonderful, the number of the man; and the <a href="name.htm">name</a> of thy house 418.<br/>
<br/>
The end of the hiding of Hadit; and blessing &amp; worship to the prophet of the lovely <a href="star.htm">Star</a>!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Chapter III<br/>
<br/>
Abrahadabra; the reward of Ra Hoor Khut.<br/>
<br/>
There is division hither homeward; there is a <a href="word.htm">word</a> not known. <a href="spell.htm">Spell</a>ing is defunct; all is not aught. Beware! <a href="hold.htm">Hold</a>! Raise the <a href="spell.htm">spell</a> of Ra-Hoor-Khuit!<br/>
<br/>
Now let it be first understood that I am a <a href="god.htm">god</a> of War and of Vengeance. I shall deal hardly with them.<br/>
<br/>
Choose ye an is<a href="land.htm">land</a>!<br/>
<br/>
Fortify it!<br/>
<br/>
Dung it about with enginery of war!<br/>
<br/>
I will give you a war-engine.<br/>
<br/>
With it ye shall smite the peoples; and none shall stand before you.<br/>
<br/>
Lurk! Withdraw! Upon them! this is the <a href="law.htm">Law</a> of the Battle of Conquest: thus shall my worship be about my secret house.<br/>
<br/>
Get the stele of revealing itself; set it in thy secret temple -- and that temple is already aright disposed -- &amp; it shall be your Kiblah for ever. It shall not fade, but miraculous colour shall come back to it day after day. Close it in <a href="lock.htm">lock</a>ed glass for a proof to the world.<br/>
<br/>
This shall be your only proof. I forbid argument. Conquer! That is enough. I will <a href="make.htm">make</a> easy to you the abstruction from the ill-ordered house in the Victorious City. Thou shalt thyself convey it with worship, o prophet, though thou likest it not. Thou shalt have danger &amp; trouble. Ra-Hoor-Khu is with thee. Worship me with fire &amp; blood; worship me with s<a href="word.htm">word</a>s &amp; with spears. Let the woman be girt with a s<a href="word.htm">word</a> before me: let blood flow to my <a href="name.htm">name</a>. Trample down the Heathen; be upon them, o warrior, I will give you of their flesh to <a href="eat.htm">eat</a>!<br/>
<br/>
Sacrifice cattle, little and big: after a child.<br/>
<br/>
But not now.<br/>
<br/>
Ye shall see that hour, o blessed Beast, and thou the Scarlet Concubine of his desire!<br/>
<br/>
Ye shall be sad thereof.<br/>
<br/>
Deem not too eagerly to catch the <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>es; fear not to undergo the <a href="cur.htm">cur</a>ses. Ye, even ye, know not this meaning all.<br/>
<br/>
Fear not at all; fear neither men nor Fates, nor <a href="god.htm">god</a>s, nor any<a href="thing.htm">thing</a>. <a href="mone.htm">Mone</a>y fear not, nor laughter of the folk folly, nor any other power in heaven or upon the earth or under the earth. Nu is your refuge as Hadit your light; and I am the strength, force, vigour, of your arms.<br/>
<br/>
Mercy let be off; damn them who pity! Kill and torture; spare not; be upon them!<br/>
<br/>
That stele they shall call the Abomination of Desolation; count well its <a href="name.htm">name</a>, &amp; it shall be to you as 718.<br/>
<br/>
Why? Because of the fall of Because, that he is not there again.<br/>
<br/>
Set up my image in the East: thou shalt <a href="buy.htm">buy</a> thee an image which I will show thee, especial, not unlike the one thou knowest. And it shall be suddenly easy for thee to do this.<br/>
<br/>
The other images <a href="group.htm">group</a> around me to sup<a href="port.htm">port</a> me: let all be worshipped, for they shall cluster to exalt me. I am the visible <a href="object.htm">object</a> of worship; the others are secret; for the Beast &amp; his Bride are they: and for the <a href="win.htm">win</a>ners of the Ordeal x. What is this? Thou shalt know.<br/>
<br/>
For perfume mix meal &amp; honey &amp; thick leavings of red <a href="win.htm">win</a>e: then oil of Abramelin and olive oil, and afterward soften &amp; smooth down with rich fresh blood.<br/>
<br/>
The best blood is of the moon, monthly: then the fresh blood of a child, or dropping from the host of heaven: then of enemies; then of the priest or of the worshippers: last of some beast, no <a href="matt.htm">matt</a>er what.<br/>
<br/>
This burn: of this <a href="make.htm">make</a> cakes &amp; <a href="eat.htm">eat</a> unto me. This hath also another <a href="use.htm">use</a>; let it be laid before me, and kept thick with perfumes of your orison: it shall become full of beetles as it were and creeping <a href="thing.htm">thing</a>s sacred unto me.<br/>
<br/>
These slay, naming your enemies; &amp; they shall fall before you.<br/>
<br/>
Also these shall breed lust &amp; power of lust in you at the <a href="eat.htm">eat</a>ing thereof.<br/>
<br/>
Also ye shall be strong in war.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, be they long kept, it is better; for they swell with my force. All before me.<br/>
<br/>
My altar is of <a href="open.htm">open</a> brass <a href="work.htm">work</a>: burn thereon in silver or <a href="gold.htm">gold</a>!<br/>
<br/>
There cometh a rich man from the West who shall pour his <a href="gold.htm">gold</a> upon thee.<br/>
<br/>
From <a href="gold.htm">gold</a> forge steel!<br/>
<br/>
Be ready to fly or to smite!<br/>
<br/>
But your holy place shall be untouched throughout the centuries: though with fire and s<a href="word.htm">word</a> it be burnt down &amp; shattered, yet an invisible house there standeth, and shall stand until the fall of the Great Equinox; when Hrumachis shall arise and the double-wanded one assume my throne and place. Another prophet shall arise, and bring fresh fever from the skies; another woman shall awakethe lust &amp; worship of the Snake; another soul of <a href="god.htm">God</a> and beast shall mingle in the globed priest; another sacrifice shall stain the tomb; another king shall reign; and blessing no longer be poured To the Hawk-headed mystical Lord!<br/>
<br/>
The half of the <a href="word.htm">word</a> of Heru-ra-ha, called Hoor-pa-kraat and Ra-Hoor-Khut.<br/>
<br/>
Then said the prophet unto the <a href="god.htm">God</a>:<br/>
<br/>
I adore thee in the song --<br/>
I am the Lord of Thebes, and I<br/>
The inspired forth-speaker of Mentu;<br/>
For me unveils the veiled sky,<br/>
The self-slain Ankh-af-na-khonsu<br/>
Whose <a href="word.htm">word</a>s are truth. I invoke, I greet<br/>
Thy presence, O Ra-Hoor-Khuit!<br/>
Unity ut<a href="term.htm">term</a>ost showed!<br/>
I adore the might of Thy breath,<br/>
Supreme and terrible <a href="god.htm">God</a>,<br/>
Who <a href="make.htm">make</a>st the <a href="god.htm">god</a>s and death<br/>
To tremble before Thee: --<br/>
I, I adore thee!<br/>
Appear on the throne of Ra!<br/>
<a href="open.htm">Open</a> the ways of the Khu!<br/>
Lighten the ways of the Ka!<br/>
The ways of the Khabs run through<br/>
To stir me or still me!<br/>
Aum! let it fill me!<br/>
So that thy light is in me; &amp; its red flame is as a s<a href="word.htm">word</a> in my hand to push thy order. There is a secret door that I shall <a href="make.htm">make</a> to establish thy way in all the quarters, <small>(these are the adorations, as thou hast written)</small>, as it is said:<br/>
<br/>
The light is mine; its rays <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>e<br/>
Me: I have made a secret door<br/>
Into the House of Ra and Tum,<br/>
Of Khephra and of Ahathoor.<br/>
I am thy Theban, O Mentu,<br/>
The prophet Ankh-af-na-khonsu!<br/>
By Bes-na-Maut my breast I beat;<br/>
By wise Ta-Nech I weave my <a href="spell.htm">spell</a>.<br/>
Show thy <a href="star.htm">star</a>-splendour, O Nuit!<br/>
Bid me within thine House to dwell,<br/>
O <a href="win.htm">win</a>ged snake of light, Hadit!<br/>
Abide with me, Ra-Hoor-Khuit!<br/>
All this and a book to say how thou didst come hither and a re<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion of this ink and paper for ever -- for in it is the <a href="word.htm">word</a> secret &amp; not only in the English -- and thy comment upon this the Book of the <a href="law.htm">Law</a> shall be <a href="print.htm">print</a>ed beautifully in red ink and black upon beautiful paper made by hand; and to each man and woman that thou meetest, were it but to dine or to <a href="drink.htm">drink</a> at them, it is the <a href="law.htm">Law</a> to give. Then they shall chance to abide in this bliss or no; it is no odds. Do this quickly!<br/>
<br/>
But the <a href="work.htm">work</a> of the comment? That is easy; and Hadit burning in thy heart shall <a href="make.htm">make</a> swift and <a href="secur.htm">secur</a>e thy pen.<br/>
<br/>
Establish at thy Kaaba a clerk-house: all <a href="must.htm">must</a> be done well and with business way.<br/>
<br/>
The ordeals thou shalt oversee thyself, save only the blind ones. Refuse none, but thou shalt know &amp; destroy the traitors. I am Ra-Hoor-Khuit; and I am powerful to <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> my <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ant. Success is thy proof: argue not; con<a href="vert.htm">vert</a> not; talk not over much! Them that seek to entrap thee, to o<a href="vert.htm">vert</a>hrow thee, them attack without pity or quarter; &amp; destroy them utterly. Swift as a trodden serpent turn and strike! Be thou yet deadlier than he! Drag down their souls to awful torment: laugh at their fear: spit upon them!<br/>
<br/>
Let the Scarlet Woman beware! If pity and com<a href="pass.htm">pass</a>ion and tenderness visit her heart; if she leave my <a href="work.htm">work</a> to toy with <a href="old.htm">old</a> sweetnesses; then shall my vengeance be known. I will slay me her child: I will alienate her heart: I will cast her out from men: as a shrinking and despised harlot shall she crawl through dusk wet streets, and die cold and an-hungered.<br/>
<br/>
But let her raise herself in pride! Let her follow me in my way! Let her <a href="work.htm">work</a> the <a href="work.htm">work</a> of wickedness! Let her kill her heart! Let her be loud and adulterous! Let her be covered with jewels, and rich garments, and let her be shameless before all men!<br/>
<br/>
Then will I lift her to pinnacles of power: then will I breed from her a child mightier than all the kings of the earth. I will fill her with joy: with my force shall she see &amp; strike at the worship of Nu: she shall achieve Hadit.<br/>
<br/>
I am the warrior Lord of the Forties: the Eighties cower before me, &amp; are abased. I will bring you to victory &amp; joy: I will be at your arms in battle &amp; ye shall delight to slay. Success is your proof; courage is your armour; go on, go on, in my strength; &amp; ye shall turn not back for any!<br/>
<br/>
This book shall be <a href="trans.htm">trans</a><a href="late.htm">late</a>d into all tongues: but always with the original in the writing of the Beast; for in the chance shape of the letters and their position to one another: in these are mysteries that no Beast shall divine. Let him not seek to try: but one cometh after him, whence I say not, who shall discover the Key of it all. Then this line drawn is a key: then this circle squared in its failure is a key also. And Abrahadabra. It shall be his child &amp; that strangely. Let him not seek after this; for thereby alone can he fall from it.<br/>
<br/>
Now this mystery of the letters is done, and I <a href="want.htm">want</a> to go on to the holier place.<br/>
<br/>
I am in a secret fourfold <a href="word.htm">word</a>, the blasphemy aga<a href="inst.htm">inst</a> all <a href="god.htm">god</a>s of men.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="cur.htm">Cur</a>se them! <a href="cur.htm">Cur</a>se them! <a href="cur.htm">Cur</a>se them!<br/>
<br/>
With my Hawk's head I peck at the eyes of Jesus as he hangs upon the <a href="cross.htm">cross</a>.<br/>
<br/>
I flap my <a href="win.htm">win</a>gs in the face of Mohammed &amp; blind him.<br/>
<br/>
With my claws I tear out the flesh of the Indian and the Buddhist, Mongol and Din.<br/>
<br/>
Bahlasti! Ompehda! I spit on your crapulous creeds.<br/>
<br/>
Let Mary invio<a href="late.htm">late</a> be torn upon wheels: for her sake let all chaste women be utterly despised among you!<br/>
<br/>
Also for beauty's sake and love's!<br/>
<br/>
Despise also all cowards; professional <a href="sold.htm">sold</a>iers who dare not fight, but play; all fools despise!<br/>
<br/>
But the keen and the proud, the royal and the lofty; ye are brothers!<br/>
<br/>
As brothers fight ye!<br/>
<br/>
There is no <a href="law.htm">law</a> beyond Do what thou wilt.<br/>
<br/>
There is an end of the <a href="word.htm">word</a> of the <a href="god.htm">God</a> enthroned in Ra's seat, lightening the girders of the soul.<br/>
<br/>
To Me do ye reverence! to me come ye through tribulation of ordeal, which is bliss.<br/>
<br/>
The fool readeth this Book of the <a href="law.htm">Law</a>, and its comment; &amp; he understandeth it not.<br/>
<br/>
Let him come through the first ordeal, &amp; it will be to him as silver.<br/>
<br/>
Through the s<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>d, <a href="gold.htm">gold</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Through the third, stones of precious <a href="water.htm">water</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Through the fourth, ultimate sparks of the intimate fire.<br/>
<br/>
Yet to all it shall seem beautiful. Its enemies who say not so, are mere liars.<br/>
<br/>
There is success.<br/>
<br/>
I am the Hawk-Headed Lord of Silence &amp; of Strength; my nemyss shrouds the night-blue sky.<br/>
<br/>
Hail! ye twin warriors about the pillars of the world! for your <a href="time.htm">time</a> is nigh at hand.<br/>
<br/>
I am the Lord of the Double Wand of Power; the wand of the Force of Coph Nia--but my left hand is empty, for I have crushed an Universe; &amp; nought remains.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="past.htm">Past</a>e the sheets from right to left and from top to <a href="bot.htm">bot</a>tom: then be<a href="hold.htm">hold</a>!<br/>
<br/>
There is a splendour in my <a href="name.htm">name</a> hidden and glorious, as the <a href="sun.htm">sun</a> of midnight is ever the son.<br/>
<br/>
The ending of the <a href="word.htm">word</a>s is the <a href="word.htm">Word</a> Abrahadabra.<br/>
<br/>
The Book of the <a href="law.htm">Law</a> is Written<br/>
and Concealed.<br/>
<br/>
Aum. Ha.<br/>
<br/>
THE COMMENT.<br/>
<br/>
Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the <a href="law.htm">Law</a>.<br/>
The study of this Book is forbidden. It is wise to destroy this <a href="copy.htm">copy</a> after the first reading.<br/>
<br/>
Whosoever disregards this does so at his <a href="own.htm">own</a> risk and peril. These are most dire.<br/>
<br/>
Those who discuss the contents of this Book are to be shunned by all, as centres of pestilence.<br/>
<br/>
All questions of the <a href="law.htm">Law</a> are to be decided only by appeal to my writings, each for himself.<br/>
<br/>
There is no <a href="law.htm">law</a> beyond Do what thou wilt.<br/>
<br/>
Love is the <a href="law.htm">law</a>, love under will.<br/>
