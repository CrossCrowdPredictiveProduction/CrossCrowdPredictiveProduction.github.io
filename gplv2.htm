<br/>
&nbsp;Copyright <small>(C)</small> 1989, 1991 <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software Foundation, Inc.,<br/>
&nbsp;51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA<br/>
&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br/>
&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preamble<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; The licenses for most software are designed to take away your <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom to share and change it.&nbsp;&nbsp;By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom to share and change <a href="free.htm">free</a> software--to make sure the software is <a href="free.htm">free</a> for all its <a href="user.htm">user</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;This General Public License applies to most of the <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors <a href="commit.htm">commit</a> to using it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>(Some other <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can apply it to your programs, too.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; When we speak of <a href="free.htm">free</a> software, we are referring to <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom, not <a href="price.htm">price</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom to distribute copies of <a href="free.htm">free</a> software <small>(and charge for this <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ice if you wish)</small>, that you receive <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or <a href="use.htm">use</a> pieces of it in new <a href="free.htm">free</a> programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; To protect your rights, we <a href="need.htm">need</a> to make restrictions that forbid<br/>
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br/>
These restrictions <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>late to certain responsibilities for you if you<br/>
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br/>
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br/>
you have.&nbsp;&nbsp;You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br/>
<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code.&nbsp;&nbsp;And you must show them these terms so they know their<br/>
rights.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; We protect your rights with two steps: <small>(1)</small> copyright the software, and<br/>
<small>(2)</small> offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br/>
distribute and/or modify the software.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain<br/>
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this <a href="free.htm">free</a><br/>
software.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br/>
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<br/>
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br/>
authors' reputations.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Finally, any <a href="free.htm">free</a> program is threatened constantly by software<br/>
patents.&nbsp;&nbsp;We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a <a href="free.htm">free</a><br/>
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br/>
program proprietary.&nbsp;&nbsp;To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<br/>
patent must be licensed for everyone's <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="use.htm">use</a> or not licensed at all.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br/>
modification follow.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 0. This License applies to any program or other <a href="work.htm">work</a> which contains<br/>
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br/>
under the terms of this General Public License.&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Program", below,<br/>
refers to any such program or <a href="work.htm">work</a>, and a "<a href="work.htm">work</a> based on the Program"<br/>
means either the Program or any derivative <a href="work.htm">work</a> under copyright law:<br/>
that is to say, a <a href="work.htm">work</a> containing the Program or a <a href="port.htm">port</a>ion of it,<br/>
either verbatim or with modifications and/or <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>lated into another<br/>
language.&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>(Hereinafter, <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>lation is included without limitation in<br/>
the term "modification".)</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br/>
<br/>
<a href="act.htm">Act</a>ivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br/>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="act.htm">act</a> of<br/>
running the Program is not restricted, and the <a href="output.htm">output</a> from the Program<br/>
is covered only if its contents constitute a <a href="work.htm">work</a> based on the<br/>
Program <small>(independent of having been made by running the Program)</small>.<br/>
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<br/>
<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code as you receive it, in any <a href="mediu.htm">mediu</a>m, provided that you<br/>
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br/>
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br/>
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br/>
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br/>
along with the Program.<br/>
<br/>
You may charge a fee for the <a href="phys.htm">phys</a>ical <a href="act.htm">act</a> of <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>ferring a copy, and<br/>
you may at your option offer warranty protection in <a href="exch.htm">exch</a>ange for a fee.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any <a href="port.htm">port</a>ion<br/>
of it, thus forming a <a href="work.htm">work</a> based on the Program, and copy and<br/>
distribute such modifications or <a href="work.htm">work</a> under the terms of Section 1<br/>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a)</small> You must cause the modified files to <a href="carry.htm">carry</a> prominent notices<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b)</small> You must cause any <a href="work.htm">work</a> that you distribute or publish, that in<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; parties under the terms of this License.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c)</small> If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interactive <a href="use.htm">use</a> in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; notice that there is no warranty <small>(or else, saying that you provide<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a warranty)</small> and that <a href="user.htm">user</a>s may redistribute the program under<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; these conditions, and telling the <a href="user.htm">user</a> how to view a copy of this<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License.&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; does not normally print such an announcement, your <a href="work.htm">work</a> based on<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</small><br/>
<br/>
These requirements apply to the modified <a href="work.htm">work</a> as a whole.&nbsp;&nbsp;If<br/>
identifiable sections of that <a href="work.htm">work</a> are not derived from the Program,<br/>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate <a href="work.htm">work</a>s in<br/>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br/>
sections when you distribute them as separate <a href="work.htm">work</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;But when you<br/>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a <a href="work.htm">work</a> based<br/>
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br/>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br/>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br/>
your rights to <a href="work.htm">work</a> written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br/>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br/>
collective <a href="work.htm">work</a>s based on the Program.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, mere aggregation of another <a href="work.htm">work</a> not based on the Program<br/>
with the Program <small>(or with a <a href="work.htm">work</a> based on the Program)</small> on a volume of<br/>
a storage or distribution <a href="mediu.htm">mediu</a>m does not bring the other <a href="work.htm">work</a> under<br/>
the scope of this License.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 3. You may copy and distribute the Program <small>(or a <a href="work.htm">work</a> based on it,<br/>
under Section 2)</small> in object code or executable form under the terms of<br/>
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a)</small> Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 and 2 above on a <a href="mediu.htm">mediu</a>m customarily <a href="use.htm">use</a>d for software interchange; or,<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b)</small> Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of <a href="phys.htm">phys</a>ically performing <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e distribution, a complete<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; machine-readable copy of the corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code, to be<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a <a href="mediu.htm">mediu</a>m<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; customarily <a href="use.htm">use</a>d for software interchange; or,<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c)</small> Accompany it with the <a href="info.htm">info</a>rmation you received as to the offer<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to distribute corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code.&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>(This alternative is<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; allowed only for non<a href="commer.htm">commer</a>cial distribution and only if you<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; received the program in object code or executable form with such<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</small><br/>
<br/>
The <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code for a <a href="work.htm">work</a> means the preferred form of the <a href="work.htm">work</a> for<br/>
making modifications to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;For an executable <a href="work.htm">work</a>, complete <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e<br/>
code means all the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code for all modules it contains, plus any<br/>
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to<br/>
control compilation and installation of the executable.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as a<br/>
special exception, the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code distributed <a href="need.htm">need</a> not include<br/>
anything that is normally distributed <small>(in either <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e or binary<br/>
form)</small> with the major components <small>(compiler, kernel, and so on)</small> of the<br/>
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br/>
itself accompanies the executable.<br/>
<br/>
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br/>
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br/>
access to copy the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code from the same place counts as<br/>
distribution of the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code, even though third parties are not<br/>
compelled to copy the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e along with the object code.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br/>
except as expressly provided under this License.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any attempt<br/>
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br/>
void, and will <a href="auto.htm">auto</a>matically terminate your rights under this License.<br/>
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br/>
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br/>
parties remain in full compliance.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br/>
signed it.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br/>
distribute the Program or its derivative <a href="work.htm">work</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;These <a href="act.htm">act</a>ions are<br/>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, by<br/>
modifying or distributing the Program <small>(or any <a href="work.htm">work</a> based on the<br/>
Program)</small>, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br/>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br/>
the Program or <a href="work.htm">work</a>s based on it.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 6. Each time you redistribute the Program <small>(or any <a href="work.htm">work</a> based on the<br/>
Program)</small>, the recipient <a href="auto.htm">auto</a>matically receives a license from the<br/>
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br/>
these terms and conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;You may not impose any further<br/>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br/>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br/>
this License.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br/>
infringement or for any other reason <small>(not limited to patent issues)</small>,<br/>
conditions are imposed on you <small>(whether by court order, agreement or<br/>
otherwise)</small> that con<a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ict the conditions of this License, they do not<br/>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you cannot<br/>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br/>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br/>
may not distribute the Program at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if a patent<br/>
license would not permit royalty-<a href="free.htm">free</a> redistribution of the Program by<br/>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br/>
the only way you could satisfy <a href="bot.htm">bot</a>h it and this License would be to<br/>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br/>
<br/>
If any <a href="port.htm">port</a>ion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br/>
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br/>
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br/>
circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br/>
patents or other <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty right claims or to contest validity of any<br/>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br/>
integrity of the <a href="free.htm">free</a> software distribution system, which is<br/>
implemented by public license practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people have made<br/>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br/>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br/>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br/>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br/>
impose that choice.<br/>
<br/>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br/>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 8. If the distribution and/or <a href="use.htm">use</a> of the Program is restricted in<br/>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br/>
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br/>
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br/>
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br/>
countries not thus excluded.&nbsp;&nbsp;In such case, this License incorporates<br/>
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 9. The <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br/>
of the General Public License from time to time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such new versions will<br/>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br/>
address new problems or concerns.<br/>
<br/>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Program<br/>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any<br/>
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br/>
either of that version or of any later version published by the <a href="free.htm">Free</a><br/>
Software Foundation.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Program does not specify a version number of<br/>
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software<br/>
Foundation.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other <a href="free.htm">free</a><br/>
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<br/>
to ask for permission.&nbsp;&nbsp;For software which is copyrighted by the <a href="free.htm">Free</a><br/>
Software Foundation, write to the <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software Foundation; we sometimes<br/>
make exceptions for this.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our decision will be guided by the two goals<br/>
of pre<a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ing the <a href="free.htm">free</a> status of all derivatives of our <a href="free.htm">free</a> software and<br/>
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NO WARRANTY<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED <a href="free.htm">FREE</a> OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br/>
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.&nbsp;&nbsp;EXCEPT WHEN<br/>
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br/>
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<br/>
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br/>
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp;&nbsp;THE ENTIRE RISK AS<br/>
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.&nbsp;&nbsp;SHOULD THE<br/>
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE <a href="cost.htm">COST</a> OF ALL NECESSARY <a href="serv.htm">SERV</a>ICING,<br/>
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br/>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br/>
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br/>
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br/>
OUT OF THE <a href="use.htm">USE</a> OR INABILITY TO <a href="use.htm">USE</a> THE PROGRAM <small>(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br/>
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br/>
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br/>
PROGRAMS)</small>, EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br/>
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; If you <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>elop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br/>
possible <a href="use.htm">use</a> to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br/>
<a href="free.htm">free</a> software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; To do so, attach the following notices to the program.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is safest<br/>
to attach them to the start of each <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e file to most effectively<br/>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br/>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copyright <small>(C)</small> &lt;year>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;name of author><br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is <a href="free.htm">free</a> software; you can redistribute it and/or modify<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <small>(at your option)</small> any later version.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is distributed in the hope that it will be <a href="use.htm">use</a>ful,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp;&nbsp;See the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU General Public License for more details.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with this program; if not, write to the <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software Foundation, Inc.,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.<br/>
<br/>
Also add <a href="info.htm">info</a>rmation on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br/>
<br/>
If the program is interactive, make it <a href="output.htm">output</a> a short notice like this<br/>
when it starts in an interactive mode:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gnomovision version 69, Copyright <small>(C)</small> year name of author<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gnomovision comes with AB<a href="solu.htm">SOLU</a>TELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is <a href="free.htm">free</a> software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br/>
<br/>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br/>
parts of the General Public License.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the commands you <a href="use.htm">use</a> may<br/>
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be<br/>
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.<br/>
<br/>
You should also get your <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>er <small>(if you <a href="work.htm">work</a> as a programmer)</small> or your<br/>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if<br/>
necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a sample; alter the names:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program<br/>
&nbsp; `Gnomovision' <small>(which makes passes at compilers)</small> written by James <a href="hack.htm">Hack</a>er.<br/>
