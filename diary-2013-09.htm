I have discovered a way to compensate specialization without resorting to the <a href="use.htm">use</a> of <a href="money.htm">money</a> and without enduring the "simultaneous coincidence of wants" that typical barter suffers.<br/>
<br/>
This approach is only applicable to the <a href="good.htm">good</a>s and <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ices we can predict we will <a href="need.htm">need</a>.<br/>
<br/>
But that is more realistic than you might first imagine since, for many people, their <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>check is essentially already spent even before they even receive it because they have a long list of bills to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for <a href="food.htm">food</a>, housing, utilities, gasoline, etc.<br/>
<br/>
This discovery is in some ways very simple, but in other ways quite difficult to digest because of the different view<a href="point.htm">point</a> you <a href="must.htm">must</a> take.<br/>
<br/>
I hope I can <a href="work.htm">work</a> with some of you to explain and <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>elop this im<a href="port.htm">port</a>ant <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
