Cross Crowd Predictive Production is a new business model that helps people share property and swap promises for production under their full control and at the real cost of that production.

This approach requires a VIPM operating under the constraints of the IOTA.

Investors commit property, promises or profit to receive Property Futures which are a combination of real property ownership and work promises.  They eventually receive products as the natural return from that property.

Unlike a traditional consumer-cooperative, these consumer/investors become *real* co-owners in the VIPM and receive the product as a natural side-effect of that ownership.

The VIPM does not 'pay' the investors with product; the owners of the sources own their portion of the products already, even before they is produced.

When you own an Apple tree, you own all the potential future Apples from that tree as a side-effect of owning the tree.  You do not buy the Apples because they are your property already.

When you own part of an Apple orchard in a VIPM, you own your % of the Apples as a side-effect of owning a % of the orchard.  You do not buy the Apples because they are your property already.


==Prepaying with Property
Investors may commit property directly or just pay with plain old money which will be used to buy property, both sources and 'startup' products to bootstrap the VIPM.


==Prepaying with Promises
Workers are also investors when the promise to work in the future.

Those who invest promises in the VIPM also receive Property Futures, just as every other investor.

These investments are legally binding contracts to accomplish future goals for others within some time period.


==Prepaying with Profit
Consumers are also investors when they pay profit while buying surplus.

This only occurs when the consumer has insufficient source ownership.

This is a sort of 'accidental' investment caused by the payer's dependence upon the current owners.


==An Example
A worker may promise to milk 100 cows each morning.  This commitment is coupled with land, water-rights, tools and cattle to create a bundle of Property Futures specific to cow milk.

Each of these Property Futures is sold to others within the VIPM that predict they will want milk.

Some of these Property Futures are sold for money to buy property such as land and tools and cattle, etc., while the rest are 'sold' to workers in return for work promises.

Surplus milk is sold to non-owners for a profit, but the profit is treated as the payer's investment, causing those late-coming consumers to receive Product Futures in the growth of the dairy.


==Rules of the IOTA
1. We use property ownership in the sources of production to pre-allocate the product to those who predict they will want it.

And so there is no need to buy or sell products within the VIPM when those products are already in the hands of those who will consume them.  Incidentally, this also causes production to be strictly for use-value, and eliminates profit naturally, except when selling surplus, since the price they pay as consumers is exactly the costs they pay as owners.


2. We use promises of work to schedule commitments of labor so that we do not need to pay wages in the traditional sense.

For example, A commits to work for B in return for B committing to work for A.  But a real working system would have at least dozens and probably hundreds of different products and so exchanges will be chained as A->B->C->D->E->A such that a worker can milk cattle and still have dental assurance even if the dentist is allergic to milk.

Together, these minimize the need for token-passing within that VIPM and creates real security for those participants.

The only need for external money is further vertical integration as we incrementally purchase the entire tree of production for each product we want.


3. After some time, owners will likely have surplus (especially after a few years of growth and natural regeneration of species).

Each owner can choose to do whatever they like with their own surplus, but if it is sold, the IOTA requires profit be treated as the payer's investment.

Treating profit as the payer's investment auto-distributes control to those who pay for that growth.


4. Any subgroup is allowed to split from the rest of the group for any reason while retaining their portion of ownership.  This keeps control local as the form scales in total size and resolve devisive disputes.


==Example
Say you have ownership in the Olive orchard and find yourself with 100 extra pounds of Olives. You can turn these into oil and try to burn them in a diesel engine, or you can offer them as a sacrifice to your God, or whatever you want, but if you sell them, you must treat any amount collected above costs as though the buyer had made an investment in the VIPM.

If you do all of the work of selling the Olives, then you can claim that everything the buyer paid beyond any other costs you may have incurred are your wages for doing that work or you can arbitrarily mark some of that as profit since you are not using the market to determine your wages.

But if you hire someone to sell the Olives, or (and this next case will likely be the most common) if you just let the VIPM storehouse sell any of your surplus for you, then those workers will be paid wages that are easily separated from profits, and so all you will receive all the costs needed to cover that overproduction (assuming the product can be sold at least at cost) and so you will "break even" but will never "make a profit" because all the profit will be treated as though the person who paid it was making an investment.

This means you will want to own just barely enough of each part of the VIPM as you need of each product; though actually you will likely want to own just a little bit more as a sort of 'insurance' against the possibility lean years of production caused by drought or pestilence, etc.
