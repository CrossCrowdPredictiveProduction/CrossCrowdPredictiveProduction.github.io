Cross Crowd Predictive Production is a new business model that helps people share Property and swap Promises for production under their full control and at the real costs of production.


==Bootup
Estimate the quantity and quality food, housing, sanitation, clothing, basic health-care, child care, transportation, etc. needed to support on-site workers.

Estimate the Property and Promises needed for that production and issue Product Futures toward those goals.

Sell those Product Futures to consumers (for money used to buy Property) and workers (for Promises of future work).

Part of this money is used to buy the Property portions of Product Futures such as land, tools, organisms, lumber, wire, pipe, etc. needed to build the VIPM.

The rest of the money is used to buy 'bootup' Property such as tents, bulk-food, used clothing, etc. needed to support workers until the agriculture is productive and before the permanent shelters are complete; and also to cover external services such as dental-care, etc.

Once we have the land, tools and bootup goods, the workers begin installing the agriculture and building the first of the shared structures.

These workers look at the list of work needed and signup to fulfill the 'Promises' portion of some Product Futures for which they have skills.  They are 'paid' not with money, but by receiving Product Futures representing the Property and Promises needed to produce the goods and services they need and, initially, by also receiving a portion of the bootup goods and external services needed until we are fully bootstrapped.

Anyone holding a Product Future must pay the recurring costs of production with either Property or Promises else their Property portion of that Product Future will be incrementally sold to cover those costs.

Product is the 'natural' return to Property owners.  You don't buy Avocados when you own part of the tree; you own that fruit already!

The price each consumer pays is exactly the costs they each paid as a co-owner and so profit does not exist because the Product is never sold (except when selling surplus).


==PrePaying Consumers
Consumers who invest money in the VIPM receive Product Futures which are a combination of real Property ownership and work Promises.  They receive Product as a natural return from that Property.

Unlike a traditional consumer-cooperative, these consumer/investors become *real* co-owners in the VIPM and receive the Product as a natural side-effect of that ownership.

The VIPM does not 'pay' the investors with Product; the investors are owners that own the Product already, even before it is produced!

For example, when you own an Apple tree, you own all the potential future Apples from that tree as a side-effect of owning the tree.  You do not buy the Apples because they are your Property already.

When you own part of an Apple orchard in a VIPM, you own your % of the Apples as a side-effect of owning a % of the orchard.  You do not buy the Apples because they are your Property already.


==PrePaying Workers
Workers are also consumers.

Consumers who invest work Promises in the VIPM receive Product Futures which are a combination of real Property ownership and work Promises.  They receive Product as a natural return from that Property.

These consumer/workers invest Promises by signing "work bonds" that are legally binding commitments to achive goals for others within some time period.

For example, a worker may commit to milk 100 cows each morning.  This commitment is coupled with land, tools and cattle to create a bundle of Property Futures.

Each of these Property Futures is sold to others participating in the VIPM that predict they will want milk.

Some of these Property Futures must be sold for money to buy the land and tools and cattle, while the rest must be sold for work Promises.

Once all the Property Futures are sold, the money is used to buy the land, tools and cattle, and production can begin!


==Surplus and Growth
As the VIPM becomes to productive, most of the Product is not sold, but is already the Property of each investor according to the amount they own.

After some time, owners will likely have surplus (especially after a few years of growth and natural regeneration of species).

Each owner can choose to do whatever they like with their own surplus, but if it is sold, the IOTA requires any Profit be treated as the Payer's Investment.

Treating profit as the payer's investment autodistributes control to those who pay for that growth.


==Summary
We use Property ownership in the Sources of production to pre-allocate the Product to those who predict they will want it.

And so there is no need to buy or sell Products within the VIPM because those Products are already in the hands of those who will consume them.  Incidentally, this also causes production to be strictly for use-value, and eliminates profit completely except when selling surplus since the price they pay as consumers is exactly the costs they pay as owners.

We use work Promises to schedule commitments of labor so that we do not need to pay wages in the traditional sense.

For example, A commits to work for B in return for B committing to work for A.  But a real working system would have at least dozens and probably hundreds of different Products and so exchanges will be chained as A->B->C->D->E->A such that a worker can milk cattle and still have dental assurance even if the dentist is allergic to milk.

This minimizes the need for token-passing within that VIPM and creates real security for those participants.

The only need for external money is further vertical integration as we incrementally purchase the entire tree of production for each Product we want.


==Example
Say you have ownership in the Olive orchard and find yourself with 100 extra pounds of Olives. You can turn these into oil and try to burn them in a diesel engine, or you can offer them as a sacrifice to your God, or whatever you want, but if you sell them, you must treat any amount collected above costs as though the buyer had made an investment in the VIPM.

If you do all of the work of selling the Olives, then you can claim that everything the buyer paid beyond any other costs you may have incurred are your wages for doing that work or you can arbitrarily mark some of that as profit since you are not using the market to determine your wages.

But if you hire someone to sell the Olives, or (and this next case will likely be the most common) if you just let the VIPM storehouse sell any of your surplus for you, then those workers will be paid wages that are easily separated from profits, and so all you will receive all the costs needed to cover that overproduction (assuming the Product can be sold at least at cost) and so you will "break even" but will never "make a profit" because all the profit will be treated as though the person who paid it was making an investment.

This means you will want to own just barely enough of each part of the VIPM as you need of each Product; though actually you will likely want to own just a little bit more as a sort of 'insurance' against the possibility lean years of production caused by drought or pestilence, etc.


==Another Explanation
We can produce the goods and services we know we will need on a recurring and continual basis such as food, water, housing, health-care, transportation, etc. without paying profit or rent or interest to others.

First we create 'core' businesses that are each co-owned by the future customers of that very Product.  For example, a chicken farm and tools for those who want eggs, a dental office and tools for those who want to insure their teeth will be fixed, a barley field and hops field and a brewery and tools for those who want beer, etc.  We can most likely use crowd-funding to start for each of these with the 'perk' being real co-ownership in that enterprise.

By creating a variety of these core businesses to cover each need we have, we will also be able to swap skills (exchange Promises to work) and thereby also eliminate the payment of wages in the traditional sense.

Each core business will not be profitable at first simply because we will not be selling the Product.  Each co-owner owns his portion of the Products (eggs or fixed teeth or beer) as a result of his paying his portion of the costs of production.

This may seem useless, but is actually very valuable because it creates a solid foundation for the efficiency of scale we need to compete with traditional businesses.  These customer/owners will rarely leave because it is impossible to get the Product for less than the real costs of production.

Once each core is full operational, we begin selling surplus to outsiders and charging profit against them.  This will cause the core to grow in size.

If we want the cores to remain stable as they scale, we will need to treat some % of the profit as an investment from the payer so that all consumers incrementally gain the co-ownership needed to receive that Product in the future at the real costs of production.
