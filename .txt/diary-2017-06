1. Join when you commit PROPERTY or PROMISES toward future production.
2. Workers gain PROPERTY on a work-to-own basis as PROMISES are fulfilled.
3. PROPERTY preallocates PRODUCTS to each owner/consumer in that same amount.
4. When you pay PROFIT, you gain PROPERTY in that same amount (unless running hybrid mode).
5. Any subgroup may split the PROPERTY when realistically divisible.

PROPERTY  : Joint ownership of land, water, tools, plants, animals,
PROMISES  : Commitments from a worker to achieve future PRODUCTION.
PRODUCTS  : Outputs of production including all goods and services.
COSTS     : PROPERTY and PROMISES paid by OWNERs during PRODUCTION.
PRICE     : Amount paid the CONSUMER when buying PRODUCTS.
PROFIT    : Difference between PRICE and COSTS.
