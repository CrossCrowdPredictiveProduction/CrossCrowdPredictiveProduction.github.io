MicroFund is like a CrowdFunding x TimeBanking รท ValueCapture

Anyone can dreamup any good or service and create a campaign toward that goal.



Each investor shares the costs of production and accepts the product as the natural return.

Workers are also investors who gain property as they complete work promises.

Microfund 'bundles' make it easy to choose prepackaged "standard of living" levels based on the money and/or work you are willing to commit.
