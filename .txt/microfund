microfund is a new way for groups to crowdfund and crowdsource the property and promises to produce all the goods and services they need.

The microfund app helps groups secure the property and promises needed for production.

Secure ledgers record the Property and Promises each person has a claim over.

Share the costs of production and accept the product as the natural return.

Each funder becomes part owner in the property partial recipient of the promises.

Property vests incrementally for those who fund with promises (commitments of future work).
