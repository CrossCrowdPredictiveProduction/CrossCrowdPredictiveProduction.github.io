microfund makes it easy to crowdsource and crowdfund in tiny amounts.

It is like buying future products through commitments of work or money.

A .... ledger records product requests and what you agree pay for them.

Other ledgers record property and promises needed for that production.

Each funder becomes part owner in the property used in that production.

Property vests incrementally for those who fund with work commitments.

Each microfund project is For Product and protects users with the IOTA.
