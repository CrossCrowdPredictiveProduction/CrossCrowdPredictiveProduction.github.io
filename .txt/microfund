microfund is a way for crowds to fund the property and promises required to produce the goods and services they need.

The microfund app helps groups secure the property and promises needed for production.

Secure ledgers record the Property and Promises each person has a claim over.

Each funder becomes part owner in the property partial recipient of the promises.

They share the costs of production and accept the product as the natural return.

Property vests incrementally for those who fund with promises (commitments of future work).
