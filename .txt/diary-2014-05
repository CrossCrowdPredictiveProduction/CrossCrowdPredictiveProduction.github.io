Urho3D.github.io >>Urho3D is a lightweight, cross-platform rendering and game engine implemented in C++ and released under the MIT license. Greatly inspired by OGRE and Horde3D.

Cocos2d-x.org >>Written in C++ and OpenGL ES 1.1/2.0, runs on iOS, Android, BlackBerry, Bada, Marmalade, Windows, Windows Phone, Linux and more.

CommonGreen.Weebly.com

SetTheNewGame.com >>LETS RE-CREATE ECONOMY AND SOCIETY TOGETHER!

UnSeenStudios.com >>This is a launchpad for content by the eSports personality Gillyweed and the programmer Ogre!

Ares.GoogleCode.com >>AresEd is a high-level and fully featured 3D game creation suite. It is Free and Open Source. When it is finished you will be able to make full 3D games without writing any code (although a fallback to the python scripting language will be provided). AresEd is based on the Crystal Space 3D engine and on Crystal Entity Layer for game logic. It is also based on WX for the user interface and Bullet for physics. The editor is fully physics based and shows a realtime preview of the game world.

G3D.sf.net >>The G3D Innovation Engine is a commercial-grade C++ 3D engine available as Open Source (BSD License). It is used in commercial games, research papers, military simulators, and university courses. G3D supports hardware accelerated real-time rendering, off-line rendering like ray tracing, and general purpose computation on GPUs.

2014-05-12: Trying to wrapup the theory and then start again, repositioning CCPP as a slight modification to business as usual.

I think a more prescriptive approach might be easier to understand.

Instead of explaining the inner theoretical workings, just describe the external actions and effects.

2014-05-09: Met some people involved with GNUity.com

2014-05-09: Some other titles I may not have mentioned:
Community Owned Agriculture
Basic Outcome
Security Social

2014-05-09: Promises + sources => goods & services;

2014-05-08: The input/output model can be simplified to pipeline optimization.  Within CCPP, sources are transformed into products without changing owners.
