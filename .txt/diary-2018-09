2018-09-30: AntiChatter -- Separating Truth from Popularity

Features:

Just like a web search, questions are never "off topic", but simply 'flow' to where they make most sense.

A hierarchy of questions limits users to only those groups which align with their "world view".

2018-09-29: Could we make a new coin, "backed by" or "issued against" the Means of Production required to build and maintain the physical network we need?
Each coin sold would represent real ownership in the company, but instead of holding that property For Profit, it is held For Product.

2018-09-29: A Censorship Resistant Network will use property ownership of the physical layer to achieve full dominion over that subnet.  The Smart Contract "gas" fee is modified to incrementally acquire the land, tools and work required for full sovereignty over our communication.

Ethereum "gas" pays the market price for computation
but leaves us vulnerable to owners of those machines.

The "phy" extension would require some % of "gas"
be used to crowdfund the purchase of land and tools
and work to make user owned and controlled networks.

2018-09-25: Physical Layer Management Strategy for the DApp/DAO Ecosystem

Every DApp is only as unstoppable as the physical networks it uses.

The owners of those networks can censor or throttle as they please.

Ethereum Smart Contracts already use "gas" to pay for these costs,
but the lack of control over the physical layer is never addressed,
so we are left vulnerable to established ISP and cell owners.

A suggested extension "phy" would require some non-zero % of "gas"
be invested for the paying user to crowdfund the purchase of land
and tools and work required to operate a physical network to host
future transactions.  This would cause all users to incrementally
gain ownership in the physical layer required for our sovereignty.

Cryptocoins conjure money into existence under a variety of mostly artificial constraints designed to limit the speed and destination of the next issuance.

Algorithmic rules guarantee enough scarcity to attract investors with market capitalization now around 220 Billion even with nothing of actual value backing these tokens.

Some are pegged to a supposedly stable assets, such as gold, the US Dollar, the exchange value of real estate or corporate shares.

CityCoin is an asset-backed cryptocoin alternative using Smart Contracts to reclaim and repurpose the supply chain toward the reproduction of use value.

2018-09-15: This is the same pattern as found in the "For Product" business model:

"'The essence of this proposition is that cryptotokens hold exposure to a future of potentially such monumental significance, so that cryptoassets themselves are call options on the utility value of what that cryptoasset might someday provision. Volatility of token values may then be seen as an efficient reflection of a rational estimation of the probability of realising some real utility value of a future — perhaps distant future — product that results from current cryptoassets.'" -- Medium.com/econaut/economics-back-into-cryptoeconomics-20471f5ceeea

https://ripiocredit.network/wp/RCN%20Whitepaper%20ENG.pdf
"'Ripio Credit Network (“RCN​”) is a protocol based on smart contracts and blockchain
technology, which brings enhanced transparency and reliability in credit and lending.
The protocol enables connections between lenders and borrowers located anywhere in
the world, regardless of currency. By reducing the traditional banking brokerage costs
and management fees, RCN aims to allow better conditions for both sides, creating a
better credit alternative than anything available today. By including an intermediary
agent (the “Cosigner​”), the RCN seeks to neutralize the lender’s credit risk and, in case
of a default, provide an alternative mechanism for managing the debt collection in the
borrower’s country of residence'"

We propose a design for philanthropic or publicly-funded seeding to allow (near) optimal provision of a decentralized, self-organizing ecosystem of public goods. The concept extends ideas from Quadratic Voting to a funding mechanism for endogenous community formation. Individuals make public goods contributions to projects of value to them. The amount received by the project is (proportional to) the square of the sum of the square roots of contributions received. Under the “standard model” this yields first-best public goods provision. Variations can limit the cost, help protect against collusion and aid coordination. We discuss applications to campaign finance, open source software ecosystems, news media finance and urban public projects. More broadly, we offer a resolution to the classic liberal-communitarian debate in political philosophy by providing neutral and non-authoritarian rules that nonetheless support collective organization.
