The IOTA (Intra Owner Trade Agreement) is the legal binding social contract applied to Property Futures designed to autodistribute growth to those who pay for it by treating some % of profit as the payer's investment so all users gain co-ownership in the sources used for the products they need.


==Rules
1. Property is the investor's right:
Those who invest property or promises receive titles of real property ownership in the sources of production, under the terms of the IOTA.  Any subgroup may secede for any arbitrary reason and retain their property.

2. Product is the owner's return:
Those who own sources are the natural owners of the products in that same amount.  The product is not sold (except surplus) because it is already in the hands of those who need it.  This eliminates the collection and payout of profit for those owners.

3. Promise is the worker's investment:
Workers become owners in the VIPM when they commit to work in the future, but that property is contingent upon them meeting those goals, usually within a set timeframe.  This is probably the most complicated part of the system because it requires the VIPM be horizontally diverse enough to supply at least basic goods and services such as food, shelter, sanitation, health-care, transportation, etc.  This compensates workers without paying wages in the traditional sense.

4. Profit is the payer's investment:
Owners can charge profit when selling products or renting sources, but must treat some % of that profit as an investment from the payer toward more sources that eventually vest to the person who paid so they also gain the sources needed to produce the goods and services they use.


==Constraints
As a product consumer you MAY:
 0. Use this instance for any purpose.
 1. Modify this instance by renting or buying the property needed for that modification.  (YOU ARE ALREADY A CO-OWNER IF YOU PAID PROFIT.)
 2. Copy this instance by renting or buying the property needed for that production.  (YOU ARE ALREADY A CO-OWNER IF YOU PAID PROFIT.)
 3. Share this instance or a copy - whether modified or not.
  If you share this object instance or a copy - whether modified or not, you MUST:
   A. Accompany each instance with a copy of this document.
   B. Treat all profit gained through the sale of this object or through the rental of property as an investment from that user toward the purchase of more property.
   C. Issue Property Futures against the property bought with that profit and vest those Property Futures to the original payer.
