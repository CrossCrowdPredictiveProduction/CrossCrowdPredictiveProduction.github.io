Peace Through Abundance.

We will replant our cities with gifting organisms when we know how to share costs.

I was raised on an Idaho farm by some loving and fairly light-handed Mormons.

I awoke from this slumber when noticing a grainy film of the Heaven's Gate group was so similar to Testimony Meeting.

It's funny, when a group claims the only truth, they imply the majority is misled.  The smaller the group, the more comical.

I'm a great cook and careful listener. I love to work in the sunshine.

I am a big thinker and am always fixing things and designing more permanent solutions.

I write apps to pay the bills and can fix most computer problems.

I spend most of my free time designing 'Crowd Control', which is a new way to own and organize the production of our basic needs such as food, housing, transportation, health care for our own benefit.

This system will bring control back to small scale communities, interlocking with others, using advanced permaculture to retain all value and respect the planet and just be way more fun and fulfilling.
