We have been taught the baker should own the bakery.
But what about the workers that must buy that bread?

And what if we could automate that work with robots?
Will we resist improvements to perpetuate employment?


We must look again with fresh eyes to see that every worker is also a consumer and it is the ability to consume that we must protect.

We, the workers as consumers, will buy and co-own the farms and factories for which we need the results.

When we own the sources of production and accept the product itself as the return on those investments, the price we pay as consumers will be exactly the costs we paid as owners, and so profit will not even exist because the usual transaction of buying/selling the product will not occur.


Workers need ownership in the sources of the products they need so they have a solid footing from which they can demand a higher wage or ignore offers they consider too low.

Free software is all about insuring consumers have access to sources because, under those conditions, workers cannot subjugate the users by withholding the freedoms to use, modify, copy and share that instance or future instances.

When consumers own the sources of production, workers cannot charge more than market price because competition between workers is perfected since any capable worker can begin with zero barriers to entry.

This is one part of the solution to organizing in a fundamentally different manner that increases both economic and ecologic efficiency.


Another part of the puzzle is to treat promises to work in the future as cross-investments in the means of production for which that person needs products.

This allows us to swap skills without the usual problem of simultaneous coincidence of wants faced by traditional barter.

When used together, these two optimizations create an imperfect insurance for any good or service we would like to guarantee and nearly eliminates the usual need for money within that society.


The next part of the puzzle is a negative-feedback loop required to keep the system stable as it scales in size.

Profit measures the payerâ€™s dependence upon the current owners.

Treating profit as a reward for the current owners accumulates wealth and power.

But treating profit as the payer's investment automatically distributes growth to those willing to pay for that growth instead of concentrating into the hands of a few originators.


The last known part of the solution is allowing subgroups to secede from the group for any reason while retaining their ownership so control remains localized even as the entity scales to cover the earth.


This is Cross Crowd Predictive Production.
