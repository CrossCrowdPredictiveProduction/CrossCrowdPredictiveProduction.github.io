Every worker is a consumer

     Wages chase rent,
  keeping workers in debt.

     But rent is zero,
  when consumer is owner.

 So let's gather consumers
 to pay early for products,

    then buy property
   to escape the usury.

Some consumers are workers
who will work in the future.

  Then mint a GNU money
 backed by land and work.
