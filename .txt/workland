WorkLand is a place to get things done.

Simple request system allows customers to easily describe products they want.

They place orders for goods and services, but as crowdfund campaigns.

When enough funds are committed, we buy the land and tools to make those goods and services.

Owners allow workers to access to those tools in return for some work beign done for the owners.
