Work-to-own is the 'Promise' half of a Crowd Cache contract.

Services are predictively scheduled when workers commit promises toward future production.

For example, picking more than your portion of the fruit in the orchard means you have done work for other orchard owners.

Trading work promises before production begins allows us to specialize without passing tokens while also solving the "simultaneous coincidence of wants" problem that faces typical barter.

This nearly eliminates the need to use money at all, since the goods and services are already committed to those who need them.

Mr. A may commit to work for Ms. B in return for Ms. B committing to work for Mr. A.

But more complex chains can also be arranged such as A works for B, B works for C, C works A, for example, but really to any depth.

Some requirements for this part of the system:
A way for investors to list the Products they want.
A way to find the Property and Promises required for that production.
A way to purchase the Property and secure the Promises.
