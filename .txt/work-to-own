Work-to-own is a way to trade future work for property ownership without money or debt.

We trade promises early in time, before production begins, to specialize without passing tokens while also solving the "simultaneous coincidence of wants" problem that faces typical barter.

This eliminates the need to use money within that system for those goods and services, as each is already owned by those who will consume them.

Mr. A may commit to work for Ms. B in return for Ms. B committing to work for Mr. A.

But more complex chains can also be arranged such as A works for B, B works for C, C works A, for example - to any depth.
