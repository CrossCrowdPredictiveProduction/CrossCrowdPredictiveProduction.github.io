Work-to-own is a way to trade future work for property ownership without money or debt.

Trading promises early, before production begins allows us to specialize without passing tokens while also solving the "simultaneous coincidence of wants" problem that faces typical barter.

This nearly eliminates the need to use money within that system because those goods and services are already committed to those who will need them.

Mr. A may commit to work for Ms. B in return for Ms. B committing to work for Mr. A.

But more complex chains can also be arranged such as A works for B, B works for C, C works A, for example - to any depth.

A ledger records these Promises, the Property and the future Products.
