==                    Introduction
CityCoin is a fully collateralized, asset backed, use value
cryptocurrency alternative using titles instead of tokens to
secure the Land, Labor and Capital required to regain control
of the production we can no longer trust to others.


Potential citizens may invest in 3 different ways:
1. Pay with plain-old-money to crowdfund the debt-free purchase of
    Land and Tools from the regular market.

2. Pay with commitments to work in the future in a legally binding
    manner, causing you, the worker, to possibly lose CityCoin
    titles if those promises are not kept.

3. Pay in a sort of 'accidental' way when you buy surplus product
    from other owners and pay more than the real costs of production.
    Those owners are required to invest some of that profit as an
    investment in CityCoin on your behalf.


Each investor becomes a real co-owner in the real estate and tools
and plants and animals and water rights and all other physical things
require to produce the goods and services they need.

These special shareholders are real owners who accept the product
as the natural return on investment, thereby pre-allocating goods
and services to those who predict they need them.

Workers commit to achieve future goals in return for immediate access
to CityCoin titles vesting as those promises are completed, thereby
avoiding excessive price and rent usually paid for food and housing.

CityCoin titles are valid only as long as the property and promises
required for that production are secured under these terms.

Since the product is not sold (except surplus), price equals costs
and profit does not exist since the usual transaction of purchase
does not occur for these special owners.

Any owner may sell surplus product and collect profit from those with
insufficient ownership, but some of that profit must be invested for
that very same paying user to buy newly issued CityCoins, or to buy
CityCoins being offered for sale by other owners.

In this way we can produce all our food and shelter and other basic
needs without paying profit, interest or rent.


==                    Ricardian Contract
=== Definitions
Property: All the land and tools and other non-human inputs needed to make a Product.
Promise : A commitment from a skilled human to achieve goals toward making a Product.
Product:  A *projected* quantity and quality of some good or service across time.
Profit:   Any amount paid by a consumer beyond the real costs of production.
Costs: All Property and Promises actually consumed and all the externalities inflicted by this production, including all externalities and the many costs of exclusion.


===                    Terms of Operation
1. Money becomes Property:   Investors become real co-owners with rights of secession.
2. Property becomes Product: Investors are consumers paying early for things they need.
3. Promises become Property: Workers are also investors, becoming owners as they work.
4. Profit becomes Property:  Consumers become owners if they overpay for surplus Product.


==== 1. Money becomes Property
Similar to crowdfunding, consumers prepay for future goods and services, but instead of just receiving one round of production, they become the real property owners of the land and tools that will be purchased for that production.

This may sound like equity-based crowdfunding, but in this case each investor is taking risk for the ancient reason that they simply want the results.


==== 2. Property becomes Product
Each owner accepts the product itself as the direct and natural return on investment (ROI).

Instead of selling the product to some other consumer, hoping for a price above cost, the product has been pre-distributed to the consumer who predicted they would need it.  There is no sale because it is already the individuated property of that co-owner

This allows the group to operate at zero profit even while all investors remain satisfied.  The compensation is the same amount as a For Profit investment, but inverted since the consumer *avoids* paying profit for that product.

Owners receive the same value as from a For Profit investment, but as a reduction in price.

This protects the consumer from paying the profit they otherwise would have paid when buying that product at the market.

The price each pays as a consumer is the costs each paid as a co-owner and there is no sale.  Each owns the same portion of the product as they own of the property used for that production.

Subgroups must be allowed to secede from the majority when the property is realistically divisible.


==== 3. Promises become Property
Every worker is a consumer who must also own property to control the products he must consume.

Workers promise to accomplish future goals and receive property as those promises are fulfilled.

This replaces the rent or mortgage that would otherwise take most of the wages.

Vested Property can be used as collateral to access even more valuable Property.


==== 4. Profit becomes Property.
Owners may sell surplus Product and collect more than production costs, but some Profit must be invested for those users so they incrementally gain the Property ownership required to finally also control the production they need.

You must either:
A: Issue new CityCoin titles and commit work or money toward buying that new Property.
B: Buy CityCoin titles from other owners.


=== Commentary
==== Products
Each Product instance has a window-of-validity in time enforced by constraints on production and on the lifetime of the product.

For example, a young tree does not produce fruit immediately, harvest must usually happen within a short window of time, and must be used or preserved before it gets too old.


==== Property
Land and tools must meet the minimum scale and complexity required to eventually deliver all the goods and services the owners of that city need without requiring outside trade.

The design and layout of shared structures, borders, roads, etc. would ideally be decided before the land is purchased.

A variety of templates designed in accordance with permaculture principles could be offered for guidance.

Ownership is distributed to subgroups according to the products they prepay for.

For example, if you pay for "1 Gallon of milk per month" you receive ownership in the dairy and cattle and land it sits on, and the land to grow the Alfalfa and the water rights required for all of that production and also enough CityCoin to pay the people who will do the work required for your portion.

Each owner of Property is an owner of Product in that same amount.

Owners must pay the initial and recurring costs of production by either:
. Allow 'Decay' function sell property to pay costs as your interest in that product declines.
. Supply Property or Promises for your portion of the costs of production for this group.
. Supply Property or Promises for your portion of the costs of production through another group which has a trade agreement with this group, and recursively, to any depth.
. Sell (or allow to be sold) enough of your Product to cover the costs of production.
. Secede from the group and retain your portion of the property under your own terms (within the limits of realistic divisibility).


==== Promises
Promises are commitments of future labor which are traded for Property under these terms, or for Promises from others to work for you in the future.

For example, you might commit to pick fruit in the orchard during harvest season, drive a bus during the week, and cook breakfast every other Sunday at one of the many restaurants.

For the safety of all citizens, each citizen must receive enough CityCoin to insure the production they need to remain healthy, even if unable to work.

When CityCoin is purchased with promises, it vests incrementally, as those promises are fulfilled.

Initially, all jobs required to build and maintain the city are offered for the same number of CityCoin titles, with the price increasing in a step-wise manner, such as incrementing by one CityCoin each day the job remains listed...  This isn't quite right.

You may apply for any job, but must prove you have that skill.

Trading work early in time, before production begins, allows us to specialize without passing tokens while also solving the "simultaneous coincidence of wants" problem that faces typical barter.

This creates a far more direct and real insurance (as an assurance contract) and inverts the usual incentives of scarcity and destruction toward our natural and original goals of abundance and permanent solutions.

In the regular market, mechanics, plumbers and dentists need broken cars, pipes, teeth to make the tokens flow.

But if they can instead commit "up front" to fix any trouble that might occur in the future, they suddenly hope you never have any trouble at all, since they have received your commitment to work for them (or buy Property for them) either way.

This returns work to the natural position as a problem to be minimized instead of being a confused social goal.

A guild system could help determine worker skill levels while offering advancement through free access to educational media and paid apprenticeships.

Guilds would protect owners by spreading fulfillment and quality risks across groups of workers.


==== Profit
You may sell any amount of your Product at any price, but some percentage of that Profit must be treated as the payer's investment toward issuing more CityCoin, or to buy CityCoin being sold by others.

This safely reduces Profit as Property required for production is slowly distributed to those who need the results of that production.

===Transactional Timeline
User requests some Product at a projected rate, such as >>1 Dozen Large Grade AA Eggs per week.

The user is then shown Real Estate listings near their location usable for that production.

Other users can also invest in that production by supplying some of the required Property or Promises required for that production, or for any other group using the CityCoin system.

CityCoin title are issued for each square foot of the potential purchase site.

The price of each CityCoin title is based on:
1. The market price to buy (not rent) the land and tools required for that production.
2. The labor requirements for that production.

Those paying with money must implicitly also buy enough CityCoin titles for all workers.

Once all the titles are sold, the land and tools are purchased and production can begin.

Investors becomes a real co-owners and receive the Product itself as the natural ROI.

Workers gain real property ownership as work is completed.

Trading work promises across subgroups, before production begins, allows specialization without monetization.


=== CityCoin App Menu:
. Create new Product entry.
. System issues unvested CityCoin titles according to the Property and Promises required for that Product.
. Users buy unvested CityCoin titles with plain-old-money or with commitments of future labor.
