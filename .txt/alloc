If ownership costs are more than rent collected, the system is either underused or overprovisioned.

Underuse means others would use the system if given the chance but cannot because of various reasons.

Overprovisioned means there is more than enough cars to meet the needs of all users.


If rent collected is exactly the costs ownership, there is no profit and no loss.


We will not be using profit to pay owners or workers, so if you expect to receive money, it must come in the form of wages.
