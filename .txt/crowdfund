Donation-based crowdfunding means the investors generally hope the campaign succeeds, but do not receive anything as a direct return on investment (ROI).


Rewards-based crowdfunding means the investors are consumers prepaying for a product.
This gives the workers an interest-free loan which is repaid as the product is delivered.
The ROI for these investors is usually a single instance of that good or service.
They do not become shareholders or owners of any kind so only expect one round of production.


Equity-based crowdfunding means the investors are speculators seeking profit.
These investors become shareholders who expect the product to be sold above cost to create the exchange value (profit) as their ROI.
