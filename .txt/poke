Robots will soon take most jobs.
We must be prepared for the solution.

Economics has confused us into an embarassing position.

We now believe work is a need.

Soon we will see the Means of Production because we need the results, there is no sale because the price each pays as a consumer is simply the costs each paid as a co-owner and profit does not exist because the final transaction does not occur - it has been optimized out of the equation by using property rights over the INPUTS to pre-allocate property rights over the OUTPUTS.


That's great, but how do we do that?


This solves one half of the problem.

Work is the other half.

How can we turn labor into land?

Turns out that is easy once

This also allows abundance and automation without fear.
