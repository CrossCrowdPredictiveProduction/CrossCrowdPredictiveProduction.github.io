Simple request system allows customers to easily describe products they want.

They place orders for goods and services, but as crowdfund campaigns.

When enough funds are committed, we buy the land and tools to make those goods and services.

Workers gain property ownership as they complete work promises.
vesting on a work-to-own basis

Imagine tiles [or even cubes] that fit snugly on each cell of the grid.

Each side of a tile or cube represents a different 'phase' of production.

For example, to simulate the production of bread, a portion of the grid must be used to farm the wheat. The six sides of a "wheat cube" might be: plow, sow, water, grow, reap, burn.

Another portion of the grid must hold a mill to grind flour, ovens to bake loaves and somewhere to store the finished product.

Each 'productive' cell must have a tile or cube which must be 'turned' by a player or a robot for production to advance to the next phase.

Time and work cause production to move from one phase to the next.
