Crowd Control is a new way to organize production that returns consumers to the helm of production and delivers at-cost goods and services to those who commit value early.

We use the Intra Owner Trade Agreement to enforce a set of constraints over physical assets and work contracts to create a production arena respecting user freedom in the physical realm.

1. Money commitments are treated as investments into the sources of the goods and services that person needs.  That property may vest immediately.

2. Work commitments are treated as conditional* investments into the sources of the goods and services that person needs.  The property must vest incrementally.
(*) Based on the quantity and quality of completed commitments.

3. Profit commitments are treated as accidental* investments into the sources of the goods and services that person needs.  The property must vest incrementally.

4. Subgroups may arbitrarily split/fork/secede from the majority - allowing arbitrary-sized cells to form and weild their own localized governance.

This short-circuits and eliminates some transactions; and so eliminates profits, wages and taxes on those missing transactions.

When the consumers are the owners, in exactly the right amount, they do not buy or rent the product because it is already the property of the person who will use it.  This eliminates most sales and rentals.

When workers swap skills before production, they align themselves with the natural desire to reduce work and even eliminate the job.  This eliminate most wages.

When surplus is sold or offered for rent and profit is treated as the payers investment, growth is distributed to those who need that property, for when you have sufficient property, you no longer pay profit.

When reasonably sized groups are allowed to leave the majority, the figurative cell is allowed to divide, keeping control and governance localized.
