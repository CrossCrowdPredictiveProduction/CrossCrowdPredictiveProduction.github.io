Cross Crowd Predictive Production is a business model attempting to return consumers to the helm of production and deliver at cost to those who commit value.

It uses the Intra Owner Trade Agreement to enforce a set of constraints upon physical assets and work contracts.

Money commitments are treated as investments into the sources of the goods and services that person needs.  The property may vest immediately.

Work commitments are treated as conditional* investments into the sources of the goods and services that person needs.  The property must vest incrementally.
(*) Based on how the quantity and quality of the completed commitments.

Profit commitments are treated as accidental* investments into the sources of the goods and services that person needs.  The property must vest incrementally.

Subgroups may arbitrarily split/fork/secede.

These simplifications "short circuit" and eliminate some transactions; causing profit and wages and even some taxes to disappear.


When the consumers are the owners, in exactly the right amount, they do not buy or rent the prodect because it is already the property of the person who will use it.  This imputes rentals and sales.

When workers swap skills before production, they align themselves with the natural desire to reduce work and even eliminate the job.  This imputes wages.
