This is a work of love.

Hi, this is AGNUcius - or AGNU - and really just ag. :-)

I am developing a new way (built from ancient ideas) for groups to share property, promises and profit to deliver products at cost while returning workers to the helm of production *as consumers*.

The Intra Owner Trade Agreement enforces a set of constraints over physical assets and work contracts to create a production arena respecting user freedom in the physical realm.

1. Money commitments are treated as investments into the sources of the goods and services that person needs.  That property may vest immediately.

2. Work commitments are also treated as investments into the sources of the goods and services that person needs, but that property must vest incrementally, as those commitments are completed.

3. Profit commitments (when selling surplus to outsiders) are treated as accidental* investments into the sources of the goods and services that person needs.  This property must vest incrementally.

4. Subgroups may split/fork/secede from the majority, allowing arbitrary-sized cells to form and weild their own localized governance.
