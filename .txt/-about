Cross Crowd Predictive Production is a new business model that returns consumers to the helm of production and delivers at-cost goods and services to those who commit value early.

The Intra Owner Trade Agreement enforces a set of constraints upon physical assets and work contracts to create a production arena respecting user freedom in the physical realm.

1. Money commitments are treated as investments into the sources of the goods and services that person needs.  That property may vest immediately.

2. Work commitments are treated as conditional* investments into the sources of the goods and services that person needs.  The property must vest incrementally.
(*) Based on the quantity and quality of completed commitments.

3. Profit commitments are treated as accidental* investments into the sources of the goods and services that person needs.  The property must vest incrementally.

4. Subgroups may arbitrarily split/fork/secede from the majority - allowing arbitrary-sized cells to form and weild their own localized governance.

This short-circuits and eliminates some transactions; and so eliminates profits, wages and taxes on those missing transactions.

When the consumers are the owners, in exactly the right amount, they do not buy or rent the prodect because it is already the property of the person who will use it.  This imputes rent and sales.

When workers swap skills before production, they align themselves with the natural desire to reduce work and even eliminate the job.  This imputes wages.
