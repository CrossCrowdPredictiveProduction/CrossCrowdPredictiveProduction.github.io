CarBox is a kit to convert bicycles or motorcycles into four wheeled vehicles.

It is a roll-cage with a seat, steering wheel, brakes and other controls.

Two similar bikes are clamped to each side, creating a simple car.

One drivetrain is retained and altered to drive both back wheels.

Different sizes for different applications.

Wood or bamboo can be used in some cases.
