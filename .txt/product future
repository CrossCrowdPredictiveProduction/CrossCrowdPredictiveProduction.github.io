==Definition
A Product Future represents:
0. A product of some projected quality and quantity at some rate across time.
1. The property needed for that production under the terms of the IOTA.
2. The promises needed for that production under the terms of the IOTA.

So a product future is a bundle of property titles and the work commitments that are, together, an imperfect assurance for any good or service you predict you will want.

Co-owners should advertise minimum allowable standards to avoid attracting workers unwilling to meet those constraints.

It might be useful to also issue 'tickets' against future payout instances to more closely resemble typical currency.

Each ticket would have a window of validity - where it could only be used after a starting time and before an ending time.

Product Futures and tickets would ideally be electronic, but this is not required.

Proper accounting is important to defend ourselves against someone who might try to take more than they own.

Product Futures are issued in response to any investment type - whether property, promises or profit.

Profit is accepted during the sale of surplus and then offered back to that payer as unvested Product Futures.  This distributes control to those willing to pay for that growth so products become Free (as in Freedom) for every user.


==Example 1
0. Product:  One dozen grade A, medium chicken eggs every week.
1. Property: Co-ownership in land and tools needed to operate this chicken farm and grow the feed for those chickens.
2. Promises: Commitments from all the people required to run this chicken farm and grow the feed.

==Example 2
0. Product:  Two rides on the west-side bus between 8am and 8pm every day.
1. Property: Co-ownership in bus and tools etc. to operate and maintain this bus fleet.
2. Promises: Commitments from all the people required to operate and maintain this bus fleet.


==Sharing Property
Goods are preallocated when the users commit Sources toward future production.

For example, owning .13% of an orchard means you automatically own .13% of the fruit.

==Swapping Promises
Services are predictively scheduled when workers commit promises toward future production.

For example, picking more than your portion of the fruit in the orchard means you have done work for other orchard owners.

Trading promises to work before production begins allows us to specialize without passing tokens while also solving the "simultaneous coincidence of wants" problem that faces typical barter.

This nearly eliminates the need to use money at all, since the goods and services are already committed to those who need them.

Mr. A may commit to work for Ms. B in return for Ms. B committing to work for Mr. A.

But more complex chains can also be arranged such as A works for B, B works for C, C works A, for example.

As a worker, you may choose to sign such contracts for anyone willing to accept your expertise.  These commitments are real investments.


To insure production continues, a Product Future owner must either:
1. Directly supply all the property and promises needed to cover their portion of the recurring costs of production as decided by the group.
2. Indirectly supply property or promises through cross-commitments.
3. Allow the group to trade a portion of their product for the sources that production requires.
4. Secede from the group to retain their portion of the sources under their own terms.
