2018-08-16: The value proposition of the For Product business model might be thought of as "avoiding usury" in 3 ways:

Property: Land and tools required for production are secured with crowdfunding to avoid rent/mortgage/interest-bearing-debt.

Promises: Work required for production is secured with property-as-wage on a work-to-own basis,

Profit  : Surplus product is sold above cost while part of that profit is treated as the payer's investment.

"'
Business model innovations for sustainability are defined as:
Innovations that create significant positive and/or significantly
reduced negative impacts for the environment and/or society,
through changes in the way the organisation and its value-network
create, deliver value and capture value (i.e. create economic value)
or change their value propositions.
To tackle the pressing challenges of a sustainable future, innovations
need to introduce change at the core of the business
model to tackle unsustainability at its source rather than as an addon
to counter-act negative outcomes of business. The level of
ambition of business model innovations needs to be high and
focused on maximising societal and environmental benefits, rather
than economic gain only. Business model innovations for sustainability
may not be economically viable at the start (e.g. as in the
time when the first hybrid car was introduced) but may become so
in the future due to regulatory or other changes. Schaltegger et al.
(2012) propose a typology of defensive, accommodative, and proactive
business model innovations. Defensive strategies (adjustment)
are incremental business model adjustments to protect
current business models focussing on risk and cost reduction often
driven by the need for compliance; accommodative strategies
(improvement, integration) are modifications of internal processes
and include some consideration of environmental or social objectives
(e.g. environmental protection), whereas proactive strategies
(full integration) concern the redesign of the core business logic of
the firm for sustainable development. Although all business model
innovations that deliver sustainability are welcomed, proactive
innovation strategies appear most impactful.

People need productive assets for direct use value, which they do not share with others, such as personal effects

But sharing property can increase production quantity, quality and complexity.

Market production is for exchange value.
The basis of the conflict between shareholders and consumers is the quest for profit.

The original purpose of Free Software is use value.

Free Software lets owners charge exchange value, but limits user subjugation by requiring users gain access to the virtual means of production for that software.

The objective of the company is to deliver things that will benefit to others and just in the process to make profits.

"'Equity for the community.

Tribute helps organizations build and strengthen their network of contributors. We enable them to design and manage a customized reward system based on economic incentives and transparency.

Modern organizations are outgrowing traditional firms by opening up to contributors beyond their corporate framework.

Instead of relying on a trained but limited workforce, they are leveraging external crowds to design, build and market their services, making them more efficient, agile and adaptable to change.

But as talented individuals increasingly choose to work independently,  the competition for quality services begins to rise.

The Challenge
INCENTIVIZING CONTRIBUTORS LONG-TERM
If organizations want to attract and retain talented individuals they must treat them as first-class citizens. However, currently there are no long-term mechanisms in place to reward these external stakeholders for their effort.



Businesses distribute economic value to shareholders, executives and employees, but there is no system to account for the value created by external stakeholders.


As a result independent contributors often get disappointed, mistrustful, and adverse towards organizations.

The Solution
BUILD TRUST WITH TRANSPARENCY
Tribute helps organizations attract and maintain a strong community of contributors through value accounting and economic incentives. Together with traditional monetary compensation, organizations can use Tribute to create their own contributive tokens in order to reward contributions.



Contributive tokens can be used to represent future payments at an early stage of a business, include contributors in decision-making processes, distribute shares of future profits, and more.


Mint Your Tokens
Issuing your own tokens allows you to track the value created by your community and reward individuals for their contributions.

Facilitate and Scale Coordination
Fire up activities offered to your community. Define how to reward them, have them assigned to contributors and approve them once delivered.



Tribute is an open, censorship-free and decentralized network. Our match-making services are open for everyone and will always remain free.

Find The Right Resources At No Cost
Foster Cooperation And Engagement
Encourage interpersonal interactions, team cooperation, and a common culture through monetary and reputational incentives.



Reap the Benefits of Programmable Equity
Tokens offer many more possibilities than traditional equity. Create customized incentive schemes that meet your contributors' expectations.


Embed Into Your App
Developers can use our APIs to embed token-based incentives directly in their app or social media campaigns.

WHO CAN USE TRIBUTE?





About Us
A DECENTRALIZED NETWORK BUILT AS A COMMONS

Inclusive
Business Model
To ensure that businesses pay proportionately to the value they receive and that no one is excluded for economic reasons, each organization pays Tribute with their own
contributive tokens.
