2017-01-18: It seems to be partly about potential value:

Property becomes Product.
Promises become Property.
Profit  becomes Property.

Use-value measures the consumer's desire of the product.
Exchange-value measures the consumer's lack of property.

When a consumer owns enough property, he no longer buys that product, so exchange-value for him is 0 (or undefined) simply because the transaction of selling/buying the product does not occur.

For example, the owner of a nut tree must pay all the costs of production, including wages for work he does not do himself, but he does not buy the nuts from himself - they are *already* his property - even before they are grown.  He owns all nuts that tree will ever produce, and must only pay the real costs of that production.
He does not buy the nuts.

The owners of an orchard could do the same.
They do not buy the nuts.

This proves exchange-value can be zero (or asymptote) independent of wages.
