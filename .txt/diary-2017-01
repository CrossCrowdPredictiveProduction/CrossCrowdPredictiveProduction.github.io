2017-01-07: Reading http://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/9118/what-are-the-major-criticisms-of-the-labour-theory-of-value

The first sentence claims all value comes from labor.

But value comes in 2 flavors:
Use-value measures the consumer's desire of the product.
Exchange-value measures the consumer's lack of property.

When consumer owns enough property, he no longer buys that product, so exchange-value for him is 0 (or undefined) simply because the transaction of selling/buying the product does not occur.

For example, the owner of a nut tree must pay all the costs of production, including wages for work he does not do himself, but he does not buy the nuts from himself - they are *already* his property - even before they are grown.  He owns all nuts that tree will produce and only pays the real costs of that production.

This proves exchange-value can be zero (or asymptote) independent of wages.
