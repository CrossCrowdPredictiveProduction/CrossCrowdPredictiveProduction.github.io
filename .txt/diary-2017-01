2017-01-18: It seems to be partly about potential value:

Property becomes Product.
Promises become Property.
Profit  becomes Property.


2017-01-12: How 'Free as in Freedom' Will Finally Win

The GNU GPL is a mysterious copyright license that uses private [intellectual] property ownership to create a walled garden within the immaterial realm.

This free-as-in-freedom trade agreement is designed to insure each user has the freedom to use, modify, copy and share any Object they own.

This is partly achieved by requiring users gain access to the Sources needed to change that Object.

Sources can be thought of as the immaterial Means of Production.

But we need access to the material Means of Production.

We need the land and tools needed to use, modify, copy and share all the real goods and services we need to live.

We can crowdfund the Property without debt by selling goods and services before they are delivered.

But ownership cannot be static.  It must 'flow' to those who add value to others in the community.

Time banking helps us trade Promises, but the order of operations needs some adjustment.
Trading commitments early, before production begins, allows us to for Property on a work-to-own basis and so avoid wages and bills.

These rules must protect users by assuring they gain access to the physical Sources of Production for that product.

Treating profit as the payer's investment in more land and tools, etc. needed to make more copies of that good or service causes growth to be autodistributed to those who paid for that growth.


2017-01-07: Reading http://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/9118/what-are-the-major-criticisms-of-the-labour-theory-of-value

Use-value measures the consumer's desire of the product.
Exchange-value measures the consumer's lack of property.

When a consumer owns enough property, he no longer buys that product, so exchange-value for him is 0 (or undefined) simply because the transaction of selling/buying the product does not occur.

For example, the owner of a nut tree must pay all the costs of production, including wages for work he does not do himself, but he does not buy the nuts from himself - they are *already* his property - even before they are grown.  He owns all nuts that tree will ever produce, and must only pay the real costs of that production.
He does not buy the nuts.

The owners of an orchard could do the same.
They do not buy the nuts.

This proves exchange-value can be zero (or asymptote) independent of wages.
