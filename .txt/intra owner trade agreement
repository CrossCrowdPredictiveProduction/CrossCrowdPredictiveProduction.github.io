The IOTA (Intra Owner Trade Agreement) is a legal binding social contract that owners and workers can choose to apply to their property and promises.

The IOTA requires a VIPM diverse enough to supply a basic outcome of food, shelter, sanitation, health-care, transportation, communication, etc. for on-site workers.


==Terms of Ownership
1. Product is the owner's natural return:
You own the same percentage of product as you own of sources.  For example, if you own 1% of a dairy, you automatically own 1% of the milk.  You do not buy your portion from anyone; it is already your property.

2. Sources are the consumer's investment:
You receive Property Futures when you commit sources toward future production.  You may, alternatively, commit plain-old-money to buy those sources.

3. Promises are the worker's investment:
You receive Property Futures when you commit promises toward future production.  You must complete the work at an agreed quantity and quality and speed.

Most investors will cross-commit with others to supply more sources or promises of one kind in return for others supplying the wide variety of sources and promises they need.

4. Profit is the payer's dumb investment:
You may sell or rent surplus for a profit, but must treat some % of that profit as an unwitting investment from that payer toward more sources that eventually vest to that same payer - so all users incrementally gain ownership in the sources of the products they use.

5. Property division is the owner's right:
You may secede for any arbitrary reason and retain your realistically-divisible portion of the property or sell your share without punishment.
