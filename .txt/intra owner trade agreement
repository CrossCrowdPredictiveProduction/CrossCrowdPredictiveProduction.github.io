The IOTA (Intra Owner Trade Agreement) is a legally binding social contract that owners and workers can choose to apply to their property and promises.


==Terms of Ownership
1. Product is the owner's natural return:
You own the same percentage of product as you own of sources.  For example, if you own 1% of a dairy, you automatically own 1% of the milk.  You do not buy your portion from anyone; it is already your property.

2. Sources are the consumer's investment:
You receive Product Futures when you commit sources (or money to buy sources) toward future production for yourself and cross-commit toward future production for others.

3. Promises are the worker's investment:
You receive Product Futures when you cross-commit promises toward future production for others.  You must complete any work at the agreed quantity, quality and time.

4. Profit is a product buyer's investment:
You may sell or rent surplus for a profit, but must treat some % of that profit as an unwitting investment from that payer toward more sources that eventually vest to that same payer - so all users incrementally gain ownership in the sources of the products they use.  This stablizes the system as it scales in size by automatically distributing control to those willing to pay for that growth.

5. Property division is the owner's right:
Subgroups may secede for any reason while retaining their ownership so control remains localized even as system scales.
