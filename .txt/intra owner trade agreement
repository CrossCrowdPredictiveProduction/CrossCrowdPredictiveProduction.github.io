The Intra Owner Trade Agreement changes the flow of value during production in these ways:

Property is the Investor's right.
Product is every Owner's return.
Promise is a Worker's Investment.
Profit is the Payer's Investment.
Subgroups may split the property.


===Definitions
Product:  Any good or service.
Property: The land and tools required to create a Product.
Promises: The human input required to create a Product.
Profit:   The difference between consumer price and owner costs.


===Terms of Operation
====Property is the Investor's right.
When you invest Property, Promises or Profit, you receive real Property co-ownership under these terms.  Your vote is weighted by the amount you own.

During the startup phase, saying you "invest Property" means you paid with money instead of future work, but as the form becomes more complete, it will come to mean real Property transfer.

To "invest Promises" means you commit to future labor as described below.
To "invest Profit" means you buy surplus product as described below.


====Product is every Owner's Return.
Given: If you own a plant, you own the fruit and do not buy.
Given: If you own a plant with others, each owns their part.
Claim: We can use property ownership to preallocate product.

Investors become real owners in the property used for production and receive the product as a natural side-effect of that ownership.

Similar to crowdfunding, investors are consumers who prepay for future product, but here investors are real property owners that own the product automatically and so do not buy.


====Promise is a Worker's Investment.
Workers are treated as special kind of investor that receive property on a "work-to-own" basis when they commit to work in the future for other investors.  This property vests incrementally as the work is completed, giving workers immediate access and eventually debt-free ownership in all the property needed to produce all their food, housing, clothing, sanitation, health care, etc. as long as they fulfill those promises.

Some investors will choose live on-site from the beginning in temporary structures to begin building the first shared housing structure.  Agriculture should be integrated in the community in a careful way to achieve the same beauty as ornamental species while also creating the food security we must have.

Skills and capability must be proven, in some cases on a daily basis (to operate dangerous machinery, for example).

On-site investors also need immediate shelter (even if just tents), cooking tools to turn raw ingredients into nearly free food, a rigorous sanitation plan, first aid supplies and references to enable low-cost, on-site basic healthcare.

Trading promises early in time allows us to specialize without passing tokens by solving the "simultaneous coincidence of wants" problem that faces typical barter.  This arrangement also reverses the usual drive to perpetuate work and promotes permanent solutions.

Jobs are offered through a reverse-bid auction.

Each group chooses who they will accept as workers.

Worker guilds could offer stronger quality assurance.


====Profit is the Payer's Investment.
Surplus may be sold at any price, but part* of that profit must be used to buy more property vesting to the consumer who paid.

The GNU GPL requires users gain access to the immaterial Sources of every object they use.
The IOTA requires consumers gain access to the material Sources of every product they use.

The IOTA does this by 'reflecting' part of profit back to the consumer who paid it as their investment in either buying surplus property or new property.  So when you buy some surplus product, you automatically receive property ownership in the land and tools required to create yet more of that good or service.

Under these terms, whenever a consumer pays profit, they gain a small amount of ownership in the land, water, plants, animals, tools, etc. required to create future copies of that product.

This causes the physical sources of production to be incrementally and continuously redistributed to those who pay for that growth.  As those consumers gain property ownership in farms and factories, they regain control of production and pay only real costs.

Treating some profit as an investment from the payer causes property to be automatically distributed to those who paid for that growth and causes profit to naturally approach zero.

(*) The more Profit treated as Payer Investment, the more quickly the system will stabilize.


====Subgroups may split the property.
Under constraint of realistic divisibility, subgroups must be allowed to split from the majority while retaining property rights - allowing cells to divide and wield their own localized governance.


===Notes
The IOTA changes the usual order of business operations to adjust the flow of value and realign group purpose with ecology and our natural goals of peace and abundance.
