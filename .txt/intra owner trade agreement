The IOTA (Intra Owner Trade Agreement) is a legally binding social contract you may apply to your property and promises.


==Terms of Ownership
1. Property is the consumer's investment:
You receive Product Futures when you commit property (or money to buy property) toward future production.

2. Promises are the worker's investment:
You receive Product Futures when you cross-commit promises toward future production.

For 1 & 2: You must commit enough for the products you want plus enough to compensate those who supply any property or promises that is not your own.

3. Product is the owner's natural return:
As an owner of sources, you own the same percentage of product automatically.  For example, if you own 1% of a dairy, you automatically own 1% of the milk without any sort of purchase.

4. Profit is the payer's investment:
As an owner of sources, you may sell your product and charge profit, but must treat that profit as an investment from that same payer toward more sources.

5. Division is the owner's right:
Subgroups may split from the group at any time and for any reason without punishment.  Subgroups may secede for any reason while retaining their ownership so control remains localized even as system scales.
