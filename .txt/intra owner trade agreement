Similar to how the GNU GPL uses copyright to protect consumers in the immaterial realm, the IOTA uses private property rights to protect users in the material world.

The GNU GPL requires consumers gain access to the Sources of every product they use.  Sources are essentially the immaterial Means of Production.

The IOTA achives this by requiring part of profit be invested for the consumer who paid it, thereby incrementally distributing growth to those who pay for that growth.  So whenever a consumer pays profit, they gain a small amount of property ownership in the land, water, plants, animals, tools, etc. required to create future copies of that product.


===INTRA OWNER TRADE AGREEMENT
====1. Product is the Investor's return.
Given: If you own a plant, you own the fruit and do not buy.
Given: If you own a plant with others, each owns their part.
Claim: We can use property ownership to preallocate product.

Investors become real owners in the property used for production and receive the product as a natural side-effect of that ownership.

Similar to crowdfunding, investors are consumers who prepay for future product, but here investors are property owners that own the product automatically and so do not buy.

====2. Promise is a Worker's Investment.
Workers are treated as special kind of investor that receive property on a "work-to-own" basis when they commit to work in the future for other investors.  This property vests incrementally as the work is completed, giving workers immediate access and eventually debt-free ownership in all the property needed to produce all their food, housing, clothing, sanitation, health care, etc. as long as they fulfill those promises.

Skills and capability must be proven, in some cases on a daily basis (to operate dangerous machinery, for example).

Workers also need

Trading promises early in time allows us to specialize without passing tokens by solving the "simultaneous coincidence of wants" problem that faces typical barter.  This arrangement also reverses the usual drive to perpetuate work and promotes permanent solutions.

====3. Profit is the Payer's Investment.
Surplus may sold at any price, but part of the profit must be used to buy more property that will eventually vest to the consumer who paid.

Treating some profit as an investment from the payer causes property to be automatically distributed to those who paid for that growth and causes profit to naturally approach zero.

====4. Subgroups may split the property.
Under constraint of realistic divisibility, subgroups must be allowed to split from the majority while retaining property rights to allowing cell division form and wield their own localized governance.
