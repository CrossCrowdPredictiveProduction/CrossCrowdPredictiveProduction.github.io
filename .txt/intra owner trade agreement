The IOTA (Intra Owner Trade Agreement) is a legally binding social contract you may apply to your property and promises.


==Terms of Ownership
1. Product is the owner's natural return:
As owner of a Product Future, you own that same percentage of the product automatically.  For example, if you own 1% of a dairy, you automatically own 1% of the milk.  This requires you also supply the consumable sources and labor needed for that production, or supply compensation for others supplying those inputs.

2. Property is the consumer's investment:
You receive Product Futures when you commit property (or money to buy property) toward future production.

3. Promises are the worker's investment:
You receive Product Futures when you cross-commit promises toward future production.

4. Profit is the payer's investment:
You receive Product Futures if you pay more than cost when buying products under this agreement.

5. Division is the owner's right:
Subgroups may fork from the group at any time and for any reason without punishment while retaining their ownership so control remains localized even as the system scales.
