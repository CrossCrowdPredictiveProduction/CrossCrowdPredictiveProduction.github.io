The GNU GPL uses Copyright to protect users in the immaterial realm.

The IOTA uses Property Rights to protect users in the material world.

These are the freedoms to use, modify, copy and share any product under these terms.

Both the GNU GPL and the IOTA put no restriction upon use.

The IOTA protects the user here even further, requiring each IOTA owner be allowed access to the real Sources - meaning the land and tools and living things - used to produce the good and services we need.

The use value of production can be preserved by owning property and promises for good.

The GNU GPL requires consumers gain access to the Sources of every product they use.

The IOTA does the same in the material realm by requiring part of profit be invested for the consumer who paid it, thereby causing ownership in the Physical Sources to be incrementally distributed to those who paid for that growth.

Under these terms, whenever a consumer pays profit, they gain a small amount of property ownership in the land, water, plants, animals, tools, etc. required to create future copies of that product.


===INTRA OWNER TRADE AGREEMENT

====1. Product is the Investor's return.
Given: If you own a plant, you own the fruit and do not buy.
Given: If you own a plant with others, each owns their part.
Claim: We can use property ownership to preallocate product.

Investors become real owners in the property used for production and receive the product as a natural side-effect of that ownership.

Similar to crowdfunding, investors are consumers who prepay for future product, but here investors are property owners that own the product automatically and so do not buy.

====2. Promise is a Worker's Investment.
Workers are treated as special kind of investor that receive property on a "work-to-own" basis when they commit to work in the future for other investors.  This property vests incrementally as the work is completed, giving workers immediate access and eventually debt-free ownership in all the property needed to produce all their food, housing, clothing, sanitation, health care, etc. as long as they fulfill those promises.

Some investors will choose live on-site from the beginning in temporary structures to begin building the first shared housing structure.  Agriculture should be integrated in the community in a careful way to achieve the same beauty as ornamental species while also creating the food security we must have.

Skills and capability must be proven, in some cases on a daily basis (to operate dangerous machinery, for example).

Workers also need have access to some off-the-shelf solutions for shelter such as tents, bulk food items to cook meals, tools to make basic sanitation solutions and first aid.

Trading promises early in time allows us to specialize without passing tokens by solving the "simultaneous coincidence of wants" problem that faces typical barter.  This arrangement also reverses the usual drive to perpetuate work and promotes permanent solutions.

====3. Profit is the Payer's Investment.
Surplus may sold at any price, but part of the profit must be used to buy more property that will eventually vest to the consumer who paid.

Treating some profit as an investment from the payer causes property to be automatically distributed to those who paid for that growth and causes profit to naturally approach zero.

====4. Subgroups may split the property.
Under constraint of realistic divisibility, subgroups must be allowed to split from the majority while retaining property rights to allowing cell division form and wield their own localized governance.
