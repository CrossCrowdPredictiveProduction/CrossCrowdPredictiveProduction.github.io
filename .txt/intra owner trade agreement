The IOTA (Intra Owner Trade Agreement) is a legally binding social contract you may apply to your property and promises.


==Terms of Ownership
1. Product is the owner's natural return:
This means the owner of inputs is the owner of outputs automatically.  You own the same percentage of product as you own of sources.  For example, if you own 1% of a dairy, you automatically own 1% of the milk.  You do not buy your portion from anyone; it is already your property.

2. Property is the consumer's investment:
This means you may invest physical assets such as land, water-rights, tools, etc.  You receive Product Futures when you commit property (or money to buy property) toward future production.  You must commit enough for the products you want plus enough to compensate those who will do the work.

3. Promises are the worker's investment:
This means you may invest future labor if those accepting these promises consider you qualified.  You receive Product Futures when you cross-commit promises toward future production for others.  You must commit enough for the products you want plus enough to compensate those who supply the property.

4. Profit is a product buyer's investment:
This means we will charge profit against those who buy surplus product but then treat that profit as the payer's investment.  You may sell or rent surplus for a profit, but must treat some % of that profit as an unwitting investment from that payer toward more sources that eventually vest to that same payer - so all users incrementally gain ownership in the sources of the products they use.  This stablizes the system as it scales in size by automatically distributing control to those willing to pay for that growth.

5. Property division is the owner's right:
This means subgroups may split from the group at any time and for any reason without punishment.  Subgroups may secede for any reason while retaining their ownership so control remains localized even as system scales.
