"'An economy is dependent on the production of goods and services, hence factors of production are required for the production of goods and services. They are broadly divided in the three factors of production: land, labor, and capital. Land is the primary factor of production. Labor is the specific factor of production and payment is made in the form of wage. Capital is regarded as secondary factor of production as it can be manipulated by economic activity. Payment received would be in the form of interest. Later Entrepreneurship was added as the fourth factor of production. It earns profit to the entrepreneur.'" -- Wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_payments
