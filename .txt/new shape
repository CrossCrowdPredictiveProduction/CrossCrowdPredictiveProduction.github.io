This is a plan for groups to own and control the production of all the goods and services they need without help from corporations, governments or banks.

The land, tools and work needed to create a privately owned micro city are secured without debt through a modified crowdfunding campaign.

===Terms of Operation
.1 When you prepay for products, you become a real property owner in the land and tools needed for that production and accept the product itself as the return on that investment.

.2 When you promise to work in the future, you receive access to property that vests on a work-to-own basis.

.3 When you pay profit while buying surplus, some of that profit is treated as your investment, causing you to become a real property owner in the land and tools needed for that production.  This is patterned after the GNU GPL requiring Users gain access to source code.


====Timeline
Estimate scale of property and promises needed to create an acceptable standard of living.

Crowd Fund the land and tools we need with perks being the goods and services we produce.

Those who pay with money become property owners, accept the product as ROI and so avoid paying profit.

Those who pay with commitments to work (Promises) receive immediate access to property which vests incrementally to protect the rest of the group from someone who refuses to do the work they promised to do.

Work returns to a problem we can safely minimize and automation becomes our friend.

Treating profit as the payer's investment distributes growth to those who pay for it.
