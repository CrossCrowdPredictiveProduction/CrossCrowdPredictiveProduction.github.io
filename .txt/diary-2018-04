2018-04-05: Owning Property For Product

There is a cyclic flow of materials.
And usually a counter-cycle of money.


      ENTITY       |       ACTION      |       MATERIAL
-----------------------------------------------------------
       oven        |        bake       |       bread
                   |                   |
 farm        cafe  |  grow        eat  | grain       meal
                   |                   |
       soil        |        emit       |       shit


But when property is used to preallocate goods,
and promises are used to schedule future services,
the need of a money counter-cycle is eliminated.
