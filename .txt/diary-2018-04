2018-04-27: At ReplaceCapitalism.com, Marshall Brain clarifies some of the troubles and side-effects of owning property for profit.

He then estimates the land, tools and work required to supply the food, water, sanitation, shelter, transport, education for 1,000,000 people.

Let's scale to 1,000 or even 100, and 10, and even 1 just for completeness.

1 person on an island owns everything, so cannot pay rent.

2018-04-27: I just realized land coin could be generalized to include any property we might want to share, so maybe property coin, thing-coin, gamecoin, volume, 3D, cubecoin, voxel, FPS, arena but beyond production toward visual modeling of finance and ownership of those assets.

So the app/game would let you list any property for sale, then suggest templates for how to divide and schedule access.

When owners charge a price higher than real operational costs,

In this way profit flows from consumers to owners.

But if those consumers owned the property required for that production,
and if they accepted the product itself as the return on investment,
there would be no sale and so no profit.

The price each pays as a consumer is the costs each paid as an owner.

If profit is the difference between consumer price and owner costs, why would the consumer not be the owner?

Every worker is a consumer.

Workers must own the land and tools required to produce what they must consume.

Owning for product will allow us to address issues in a more complete manner because there is no reward in perpetuating problems.


2018-04-15:
Some say profit belongs to the worker.  But profit is not what we think it is.

Profit arises from the consumers' lack of ownership in the Means of Production.

This is obvious for the solitary owner of something simple like a fruit tree.

If you own a tree, you own the fruit.
You do not buy - it is yours already.

You or someone else may do the work.
Wages are just a cost of production.

Profit is usually the difference between
the price the consumer pays, and
the costs (including wages) that the owners paid.

If a group of people own an orchard,
and accept the fruit itself as ROI,
they do not buy - each owns already.

When groups of consumers own land and tools required to produce what they need,
and when they accept the product itself as the natural return for those risks.
There is no sale because the owners of the inputs are the owner of the outputs.

Profit is undefined when product is ROI
because the price each pays as a consumer
is exactly the costs each paid as a co-owner.

When we, as groups of consumers, finally realize we already pay all the costs, we will begin to organize to own the farms and factories and mines and refineries for the stupid reason that we simply need the results of that production instead of believing we must sell the product to another group of hapless consumers with the hope we might charge more than the real costs of production.

2018-04-05: Owning Property For Product

There is a cyclic flow of materials.
And usually a counter-cycle of money.

      INPUT                WORK                OUTPUT
      ENTITY       |       ACTION      |       MATTER
-----------------------------------------------------------
       oven        |        bake       |       bread
                   |                   |
 farm        cafe  |  grow        eat  | grain       meal
                   |                   |
       soil        |        emit       |       shit


But when property is used to preallocate goods,
and promises are used to schedule future services,
the need of a money counter-cycle is eliminated.
