Property rights are a legal mechanism used to secure the non-human inputs and outputs of production.

Future input property commitments are Sources.
Finished output property commitments are goods.

"Properly Rights" (sometimes "Property Left" or PropertyLeft) is a constrained form of property rights created when owners choose to apply the IOTA to their property.

Most property can usually be purchased with money.

The owner of Sources is the owner of Products in that same amount.
