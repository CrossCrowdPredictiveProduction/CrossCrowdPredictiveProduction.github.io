2014-03-07: Steve Ballmer singing "Developers Developers Developers Developers!" at YouTube.com/watch?v=KMU0tzLwhbE reminds me of "Workers of the World Unite!".

Contrast this with the message of "User Freedom" from Saint IGNUcius.

2014-03-04: I was thinking about how to implement the CCPP website and realized the commitments must be stored in a distributed and group-verifiable manner similar to the approach used by bitcoin to validate transactions.

2014-03-03: A month or so ago I was thinking about what it would take to create a fully counterbalanced elevator.  Imagine using a closed loop of cable with sand deposited or removed from platforms on the side opposite the cargo.  Thinking about this further, I realized each person moving into such an apartment building must make an initial 'deposit' by carrying enoughsand to their floor needed to counterbalance their own body weight plus the weight of other things such as furniture and groceries.  I also noticed there is a 'lifecycle' for each item.  For example, a couch may stay in the apartment for years, but most groceries will be transformed into energy and waste products.  If we can use the waste product for counterbalance (say transporting compost and trash and excrement to the ground level), then the tenant will only be required to make a weight deposit (carry sand up the stairs) in the amount that was transformed into energy.  This pattern has some amount of application toward understanding economic systems.

2014-03-03: Thinking of representing CCPP as resource preparation maybe similar to Tower Defense strategies.
