Crowd Cache is a community currency backed by the Property and Promises needed to create and maintain the many Products that community needs.

The rules covering this production are described in the IOTA.


==== DEFINITIONS
PRODUCTS: Are a *projected* return on investment, and are only as good as the Property and Promises required for that production minus disasters and other trouble.

PROPERTY: All the land and tools and other non-human inputs needed to make those Products.

PROMISES: Commitments from qualified humans to achieve the work needed to make those Products.


==== ISSUANCE
Crowd Cache is "backed by" or "issued against" the Property and Promises needed to create and maintain food, housing, sanitation, clothing, health care, transport, etc.

Issuance is a response to an investment, where investments are one of:

A. Property - When someone commits land or tools or even just plain-old-money toward production.
B. Promises - When someone commits to achieve future goals, they receive immediate access to property which then vests on a work-to-own basis.
C. Profit   - When someone pays more than cost, that profit becomes the payer's investment.


==== PROPERTY
To insure production continues, a Crowd Cache owner must either:
1. Directly supply all the property and promises needed to cover their portion of the recurring costs of production as decided by the group.
2. Indirectly supply property or promises through cross-commitments.
3. Allow the group to trade a portion of their product for the sources that production requires.
4. Secede from the group to retain their portion of the property under their own terms.

Property owners are Product owners in that same amount when they pay their portion of the costs for that round of production.


==== PROMISES
Promises are commitments of future labor, traded for access to property on a work-to-own basis as described in Crowd Control.

For example, if you commit to pick more than your portion of the fruit in the orchard, you have 'paid' other orchard owners who may not want to do that work.

Trading work early in time allows us to specialize without passing tokens while also solving the "simultaneous coincidence of wants" problem that faces typical barter.


==== NOTES
Each product instance has a window-of-validity in time enforced by constraints on production and on the lifetime of the product.  For example, a sapling does not produce fruit immediately, and each harvest is must be used before it gets too old.

Crowd Cache is really just a secure public ledger recording the INPUTS and OUTPUTS of production.

A bulletin-board [paper first, code later] to determine demand and aquire commitments:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|     OUTPUTS (demands)  |                  INPUTS (commitments)               |
+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
|    Future Product      |     Required Property    |    Required Promises     |
|  Any good or service   |  Usually external money  |  Skills to be applied    |
| Quality*Quantity*Rate    used to buy the property | or automation to solve   |
+------------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+
| 1 dozen AAA eggs/week  | land, chickens, tools    | raise, tend, gather eggs |
| 1 gal AA Milk/week     | land, cattle, barn       | feed, tend, milk         |
|                        |                          |                          |
|                        |                          |                          |
|                        |                          |                          |
|                        |                          |                          |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You 'buy' a Future Product by committing work or money toward one of the many Products being offered within that community.

You become a real co-owner and eventually receive the Product as the natural reward of that ownership.
