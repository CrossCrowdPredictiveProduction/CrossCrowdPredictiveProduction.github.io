2017-10-26: Switching the order of operations returns our incentive toward abundance.
Part of the complexity here is that we must have both property and promises for production.
Can we, and even *should* we create a money backed both work and land?
Or should they be separated - I think more this way each day...

WorkCoin

Hmm......

The GNU GPL reconfigures the rules of Copyright

Yes, let's reconfigure property rules by crowdfunding land and tools to make a new kind of city which is privately owned by a group of groups.

We already pay all the costs of production and even more when we pay profit,
so it is easy to see we can afford to be the owners of the means of production.
We must own that we own that property for product.

We can repair SaaSS and learn to share hardware for our own mutual benefit.
