Hmm......

The GNU GPL reconfigures the rules of Copyright

Yes, let's reconfigure property rules by crowdfunding land and tools to make a new kind of city which is privately owned by a group of groups.

We must own that we own that property for product.

We can repair SaaSS and learn to share hardware for our own mutual benefit.
