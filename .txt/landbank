LandBank is a secure public record of property and promises held For Product.

This cryptocurrency alternative is a set of production chain optimizations.

Smart Contracts and a web UI help users buy, own, rent, work, vote, insure.

Groups crowdfund the property and promises required to produce all they need.

Users prepay with money or work and become real co-owners of land and tools.

This "pre-allocates" goods and services to those who predict they need them.

Surplus product is sold for profit which is treated as the user's investment.

Profit proves scarcity so triggers the purchase of more sources of that kind.


==== Definitions
Property: All the land and tools and other non-human inputs needed to make a Product.
Promise : A commitment from a skilled human to achieve goals toward making a Product.
Product:  A *projected* quantity and quality of some good or service across time.
Profit:   Any amount paid by a consumer beyond the real costs of production.
Costs: Property and Promises actually consumed and all the externalities inflicted by this production, including various costs of exclusion.


===Transactional Timeline
User opens LandBank.app

Menu shows:
. Create new Product entry.
. Activate new Product entry to issue unvested LandBank shares for Property and Promises.
. Buy unvested LandBank shares with Property [or any valid 'external' money to buy Property].
. Buy unvested LandBank shares with Promises [may commit after being verified in that skill].
. Change Product entries just as you would edit a wiki page. Each change creates a fork which is locally enforced and globally offered to those who might be interested in other variations. If the parent entry pulls those changes into it's repo, the fork is dissolved and the sugroup reunited.

By default the system shows real estate listings that are more local and meet the scale and environmental limits of each group.  This is an iterative process as the group grows and concensus changes.

Each Property owners are Product owners in that same amount if they supply their portion of the costs for that round of production.


==== PROMISES
Promises are commitments of future labor which are traded for Property or for other Promises.

For example, if you commit to pick more than your portion of the fruit in the orchard, you have 'paid' other orchard owners who may not want to do that work.  You may

Trading work early in time allows us to specialize without passing tokens while also solving the "simultaneous coincidence of wants" problem that faces typical barter.


==== NOTES
Each Product instance has a window-of-validity in time enforced by constraints on production and on the lifetime of the product.  For example, a young tree does not produce fruit immediately, harvest must usually happen within a short window of time, and must be used or preserved before it gets too old.

A bulletin-board [paper or code] lists requests and commitments.

====Flow
User requests some Product at a projected rate, such as >>1 Dozen Large Grade AA Eggs per week.

Other users can also invest in that production by committing to supply Property or Promises.

Trading Promises with other LandBank groups allows specialization without monetization.

Land acquisition can begin once the group agrees on the scope and scale of the operation.

Each investor becomes a real co-owner and receives the Product itself as the natural ROI.


==== LandBank retention requires each co-owner either:
. Supply Property or Promises toward the recurring costs of production for this group.
. Supply Property or Promises toward the recurring costs of production through another group which has a trade agreement with this group.
. Sell (or allow to be sold) enough of your Product to cover the costs of production.
. Secede from the group and retain your portion of the property under your own terms (within the limits of realistic divisibility).
