The ancient organizational form:
Product is the investor's return
Promise is a worker's investment
Profit is the payer's investment
Subgroups may split the property

2016-12-13: Where does money come from?
"'Governments at all levels (national, regional and local) need to raise revenue from a variety of sources to finance public-sector expenditures.'" -- Wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_taxation

The idea that government must "raise revenue" instead of "issue money"...  HA!

Envision the real origin of value.  What if we are starting clean slate - on a deserted island, for example.

We must achieve the production required to fulfill our basic needs.

How will we make that happen?  Does it require a sort of money?  If so, how will it be issued?

How can you possibly raise revenue from people who have no money :-D

2016-12-13: Is ownership bad for the economy?

"'Imputed rents disappear from measures of national income and output, unless figures are added to take them into account.

The government loses the opportunity to tax the transaction. Sometimes, governments have attempted to tax the imputed rent (Schedule A of United Kingdom's income tax used to do that), but it tends to be unpopular.[citation needed] Some countries still tax the imputed rent, like Iceland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Slovenia and Switzerland.[1]'" -- Wikipedia.org/wiki/Imputed_rent


2016-12-12: How to share property, promises, product and profit:

1. Property is the investor's right.
2. Promises are the worker's investment.
3. Profit is the payer's investment.
4. Secession is the owner's right.



But we must do this differently.
The old ways are not enough.
We need GNU rules! :-)


2016-12-10: Groups could make all they need, without paying tribute to others, if they could share the costs of production.
