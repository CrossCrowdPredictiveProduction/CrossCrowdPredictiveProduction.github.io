==                Crowd Control

Crowd Control is a transitional development strategy designed to help us own and govern the physical assets required to continually reproduce our basic human needs.

Similar to how the GNU GPL uses copyright to protect Consumers in the immaterial realm, we have created a Terms of Operation we call the IOTA that uses property rights to protect Consumers in the material.

The GNU GPL uses copyright to disallow exchange unless the Sources of the Product being exchanged are made available to the Consumer at no more than the real cost of that access.  Sources are a crucial part of the immaterial Means of Production.

Mapping this idea onto the material means the Consumer of a Product must somehow gain access to the Property required for production, such as land, water-rights, tools, plants, animals, etc.

The IOTA achieves this by requiring some of the Profit a Consumer pays be treated as an investment from that payer, causing Property ownership in the growth of that organization to be automatically distributed to those who pay for that growth.


We recognize every Worker is also a Consumer, and so each receives access to Property immediately, paying on a work-to-own basis, not with money, but by fulfilling Promises to work in the future.  Workers trade application of future skill for immediate access the Property required for food, housing, sanitation, clothing, etc. plus also receiving Promises from other Workers to apply skill on their behalf.


We also change why we own by selecting investors who accept the Product itself as ROI, thereby avoiding the selling/buying and eliminating the usual drive toward scarcity caused by Profit-seeking.


This means all investors are really just Consumers pre-paying for future Products (goods and services).  But Instead of receiving just one round of production (as Crowd Funding usually does), these investors become the *real* co-owners of the land and tools and water-rights, etc. needed for that production and then accept the Product itself as the return for that risk.

The Product is not sold (except surplus) because it is already owned by the people who need it - each owning the same percentage as they own of the Sources.



==                Intra Owner Trade Agreement

=== 1. Product is the owner's natural return
Each person becomes a co-owner when they pay with either Property, Promises or Profit.

Property means the physical assets such as land, water, plants, animals, tools, computers, etc. required for production, but most investors will just pay with money which we will use to buy Property.  Many investors will remain off-site, especially at first, but may move on-site if they qualify.

When you commit Property (or money), you receive Crowd Cache which vests immediately in legal terms, but of course does not create product until after the first round of production is complete.

Investors do not receive Profit, but instead recieve the outputs as a natural side-effect of owning the inputs.  Just as the individual owner of a single Apple tree does not buy the fruit from himself, we also do not sell/buy the product since it is already in the correct hands.

As co-owner of physical Sources, you are co-owner of the future product in that same amount.  For example, if you co-own part of a dairy under these terms, you own that same percentage of the milk, even before it is produced.

You don't buy that which you already own and you do not sell that which you need, so this arrangment cancels-out much of the usual need to transfer ownership, allowing us to avoid paying Profit and, more importantly, returns control to the hands of the people who need the results.

This is obvious for a single person owning a small productive resource.

For example, when you own an Apple tree, you own all the potential Apples from that tree as a side-effect of owning the tree.  You do not buy the Apples because they are your Property already.

Similarly, when you own part of an Apple orchard, you own your % of all the potential Apples from that tree as a side-effect of co-owning the tree.  You do not buy the Apples because they are your Property already.

You may invest as much Property or Promises as you want, but will probably only want slightly more Product than you can use directly (to protect against crop failures, for example).

Each investor becomes a real co-owner and receives the Product itself as a side-effect of that ownership.



=== Promises are a Worker's Investment.
Promises are commitments to work in the future.  Many of these investors will be on-site from the beginning, living in temporary structures.  Skills must be proven, in some cases on a daily basis (to operate dangerous machinery, for example).

Workers do not receive wages, but instead receive Property on a work-to-own basis according to what they predict they will want, limited by the amount of value (in Promised skill) they offer to other investors.

This gives all Workers immediate access to food, housing, clothing and sanitation as long as they fulfill those Promises at the agreed quality and rate.

During startup, on-site shelter may be temporary structures, even tents.  We will do all the work ourselves, so food will initially be bulk purchase of raw materials to make food onsite, part of which we will use immediately to make meals while installing the rest in a permaculture manner.

Trading Promises before production begins allows us to specialize without passing tokens while also solving the "simultaneous coincidence of wants" problem that faces typical barter.



=== Profit is the Payer's Investment.
If we sell surplus, and Profit is collected, some of that Profit must be 'reflected' back to the payer as real ownership in growth as more Property is bought in the future with combined Profits from selling any surplus.

When selling any surplus, Profit may be charged against the non-owner, but some % of that Profit must be reflected to that Payer as immature IOTAs issued *at the point of sale* based on projected monetary costs required to secure the Property and Promises.

We allow the market to set the price (or use an auction), but then 'reflect' any price above costs back to the payer by investing further and then vesting that Property to the payer.

This causes latecoming Consumers to incrementally gain access to the Sources of the Products they use by gaining real Property ownership in new assets purchased on their behalf by the current owners.

Treating Profit as an investment from the payer causes the Property ownership of the organization to be automatically distributed to those who paid for that growth and need the results, and also causes Profit to naturally approach zero.  But there will usually be some amount of Profit caused by changing tastes and new inventions.




==                Timeline

. Open discussion to find best location and size for pilot project.  Maybe farmland near a city to keep price low but make easy access for off-site investors and give us freedom to develop.

. Determine all Products (goods and services) to be offered.  Use permaculture principles to guide the selction of organisms used to produce all the food, drug, soap, cloth, timber, etc.

. Issue Crowd Cache for all Products, each backed by needed Properties and Promises.

. Write a crowdfunding pitch with all these details, including a video or two.

. Since no wages will be paid, the crowdfunding campaign will also include $1 spots (or whatever the minimum) that Workers will use to apply for employment.

. Attract Consumers to prepay (with money or Property) for locally grown Products.
.. This money is used to buy the Property required for production

. Attract Workers to prepay with Promises for locally grown Products.
.. These Promises pay for all the skills required for production.
