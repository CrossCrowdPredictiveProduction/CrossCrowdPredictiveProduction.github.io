Crowd Control is yet another way to talk about groups using the IOTA.

Crowd Control is about getting We, The People, as groups, back in control.

This is done by choosing to impose some constraints on group property.

These constraints are meant to help us retain control, even as we scale.

The value of this approach seems to be difficult for most to understand.

One confusion is assuming this is the same as a consumer cooperative.

People do not like complexity, so tend to merge concepts to simplify.

But the subtle differences create a profound difference during scale.
