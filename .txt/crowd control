==                Crowd Control

Crowd Control is a new (but more likely very old :-) transitional development strategy designed to help us own and govern the physical assets required to continually reproduce the crucial goods and services to meet our basic human needs.

Similar to how the GNU GPL uses copyright to protect consumers in the immaterial realm, we have created a Terms of Operation called the IOTA that uses property rights to protect consumers in the material realm.

We might view the GNU GPL as a sort of trade agreement that disallows the exchange of a product unless the "source code" of that product is made available to the consumer at no more than the real cost of access.  Most consumers are not interested in the source code, so it seems like an odd requirement until you realize this arrangement lowers the barriers-to-entry to nearly zero, allowing any worker to access these immaterial Means of Production.

To make this work in the physical world requires the consumer of a physical product must somehow gain access to the property required for that production, such as land, water-rights, tools, plants, animals, etc.

The IOTA achieves this by requiring some of the profit a consumer pays be treated as an investment *from* that payer, causing property ownership in the growth of that organization to be continuously and incrementally distributed to those who pay for that growth.

We change the purpose of property by only selecting investors who are willing to accept the product itself as ROI, thereby avoiding the selling and buying of the product except when selling surplus to non-owners.

Investors are consumers who pre-pay for future products and become co-owners of property needed for that production and then accept the at-cost product itself as the return for that risk.

We recognize every worker is also a consumer, and so each receives access to property immediately, paying on a work-to-own basis, not with money, but by fulfilling promises to work in the future.  Workers trade application of future skill for immediate access the property required for food, housing, sanitation, clothing, etc. plus also receiving promises from other workers to apply skill on their behalf.




==                Intra Owner Trade Agreement

=== 1. Product is the owner's natural return
The owner of a nut tree is the owner of the nut automatically.

Investors do not receive profit, but instead recieve the product itself (good or service) as a natural side-effect of owning the property (physical sources).  Just as the individual owner of a single Apple tree does not buy the fruit from himself, we do not sell or buy the product since it is already in the hands of those who will consume it.

As co-owner of property, you are co-owner of the future product in that same amount.  For example, if you co-own part of a dairy under these terms, you own that same percentage of the milk, even before it is produced.

You don't buy that which you already own and you do not sell that which you need to consume, so this arrangment cancels-out much of the usual need to sell and buy goods and services, allowing us to avoid paying profit for our mundane daily needs and, more importantly, returns control to the hands of the people who need the results.

This is obvious for a single person owning a small productive resource.

For example, when you own an Apple tree, you own all the potential Apples from that tree as a side-effect of owning the tree.  You do not buy the Apples because they are your Property already.

Similarly, when you own part of an Apple orchard, you own your % of all the potential Apples from that tree as a side-effect of co-owning the tree.  You need not buy the Apples because they are your property already.

You may invest as much property or promises as you want, but will probably only want slightly more product than you can use directly (to protect against crop failures, for example).



=== Promises are a Worker's Investment.
Workers are treated as special kind of investor that receive property on a "work-to-own" basis whenthey promise to work in the future for other investors.  This property vests incrementally as the work is completed, giving workers immediate access and eventually debt-free ownership in all the property needed to produce all their food, housing, clothing, sanitation, health care, etc. as long as they fulfill those promises.

Many of these investors will live on-site from the beginning in temporary structures.  Skills and capability must be proven, in some cases on a daily basis (to operate dangerous machinery, for example).

During startup, before production is started, workers must also have access to some off-the-shelf solutions for on-site shelter (maybe even tents), sanitation (composting toilets), bulk food to cook shared meals and supplies for basic first aid.

Trading promises early in time, before production begins, allows us to specialize without passing tokens while also solving the "simultaneous coincidence of wants" problem that faces typical barter.  This arrangement also reverses the worker's usual drive to protect and perpetuate work.



=== Profit is the Payer's Investment.
If a group or any subgroup sells surplus, profit may be collected, but some percentage must be used to buy even more property owned by the person who paid the profit.  So as the group buys more property with that profit, ownership vests to those who paid that profit.  The payer is almost always the consumer.

When selling any surplus, profit may be charged against the payer, but some % of that profit must be used to secure the property and promises needed to back more Crowd Cache issued as a 'receipt' at the point of sale based on projected costs.

This causes latecoming consumers to incrementally gain access to the sources of the products they use by gaining real property ownership in new assets purchased on their behalf by the current owners.

Treating profit as an investment from the payer causes the property ownership of the organization to be automatically distributed to those who paid for that growth and need the results, and also causes profit to naturally approach zero.  But there will usually be some amount of profit continued by changing tastes and new inventions.



== Timeline

. Open discussion to find best location and size for pilot project.

. Determine all goods and services to be offered.

. Use permaculture principles to guide the selction of organisms used to produce all the food, drug, soap, cloth, timber, etc.

. Issue Crowd Cache for all Products, each backed by needed Properties and Promises.

. Write a crowdfunding pitch with all these details, including a video or two.

. Buy farmland near a city for easy access and the freedom to develop in our own way.

. Since no wages will be paid, the crowdfunding campaign will also include $1 spots (or whatever the minimum) for workers to commit their promises.
