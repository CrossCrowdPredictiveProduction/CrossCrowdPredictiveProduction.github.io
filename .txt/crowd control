Crowd Control is a new way for groups to own and govern the property needed for the production of all the crucial goods and services to meet their basic human needs.

Similar to how owners of intellectual property use the GNU GPL to protect consumers in the immaterial realm, we have created the IOTA as a Terms of Operation that owners of physical property can use to protect consumers in the material realm.

The GNU GPL is a trade agreement that disallows the exchange of a product unless the "source code" of that product is made available to the consumer at no more than the real cost of access.  Most consumers do not know what source code is, so the requirement seems odd until you realize it reduces barriers-to-entry to nearly zero, allowing any worker at-cost access to the immaterial Means of Production.

The Means of Production in the material realm are land, water, plants, animals, tools, buildings, etc. required to make and store both material and immaterial things.

The IOTA solves this by requiring part of profit be reinvested in more property owned by the consumer who paid that profit.  Ownership in growth is thereby incrementally distributed to those who pay for that growth.

We also change the purpose of property by selecting investors who accept the product as the return on investment and so do not sell or buy the product except when selling surplus to non-owners.

Investors are actually just consumers prepaying for future products and becoming owners of the property needed for that production and then accepting the result as the return for that risk.

Every worker is also a consumer who needs products, so also receives property on a work-to-own basis as promises are fulfilled.  Workers trade application of future skill for immediate access the property required for food, housing, sanitation, clothing, etc. and also receive promises from other workers to apply skill on their behalf.

Splitters are winners when the majority is tyrannical.

===INTRA OWNER TRADE AGREEMENT
====1. Product is the Investor's return.
Given: If you own a plant, you own the fruit and do not buy.
Given: If you own a plant with others, each owns their part.
Claim: We can use property ownership to preallocate product.

Investors become real owners in the property used for production and receive the product as a natural side-effect of that ownership.

Similar to crowdfunding, investors are consumers who prepay for future product, but here investors are property owners that own the product automatically and so do not buy.

====2. Promise is a Worker's Investment.
Workers are treated as special kind of investor that receive property on a "work-to-own" basis whenthey promise to work in the future for other investors.  This property vests incrementally as the work is completed, giving workers immediate access and eventually debt-free ownership in all the property needed to produce all their food, housing, clothing, sanitation, health care, etc. as long as they fulfill those promises.

Many of these investors will live on-site from the beginning in temporary structures.  Skills and capability must be proven, in some cases on a daily basis (to operate dangerous machinery, for example).

During startup, workers must also have access to some off-the-shelf solutions for on-site shelter (maybe even tents), sanitation (composting toilets), bulk food to cook shared meals and supplies for basic first aid.

Trading promises early in time allows us to specialize without passing tokens by solving the "simultaneous coincidence of wants" problem that faces typical barter.  This arrangement also reverses the usual drive to perpetuate work and promotes permanent solutions.

====3. Profit is the Payer's Investment.
Surplus may sold at any price, but part of the profit must be used to buy more property that will eventually vest to the consumer who paid.

Treating some profit as an investment from the payer causes property to be automatically distributed to those who paid for that growth and causes profit to naturally approach zero.

====4. Subgroups may split the property.
Under constraint of realistic divisibility, subgroups must be allowed to split from the majority while retaining property rights to allowing cell division form and wield their own localized governance.

===Timeline
The pilot project can start immediately by crowdfunding the and, tools, plants, animals and startup supplies without debt.

This property is the basis of a private micro-city owned by the inhabitants.  Agriculture is carefully integrated with housing according to permaculture principles to produce all food, medicine, shelter, soap, clothing onsite.

Unlike a consumer cooperative, the owners do not buy goods and services back from themselves, but instead, each owns their portion of the product automatically.  This eliminates profit, except when selling surplus to non-owners.

A worker's commitment to work in the future is treated as an investment that vests on a work-to-own basis - meaning these workers become debt-free co-owners in all the property required to create all they need, as they fulfill their promises.  These workers do not have any bills or debt.

When selling surplus, we allow the market to set the price and collect profit, but then treat some of that profit as the payer's investment.  Treating profit as though the payer were investing causes ownership in the growth of the group to be automatically distributed to those who paid for that growth.  Over time, as non-owners continue to pay profit, they continue to gain property until the amount of property ownership is sufficient that the product is already the property of the consumer without purchase.  This eliminates profit for boring things, but there will always be some amount caused by changes in taste and because of new inventions and many other reasons.

We, the people, in reasonable sized groups, will finally own the farms and factories and land and water rights and wells and refineries and mines and forges and all the other property required to produce our daily bread.

===Scale
You can invest more than you are able to consume, and can profit nicely, but since some part of profit must be treated as the payer's investment, all consumers will eventually gain the property they need to protect themselves.

Vertical Integration must be part of our growth strategy to eventually reclaim control of the entire chain of production for all goods and services.

Treating profit as the payer's investment allows us to include others in a safe way while avoiding the typical problems of overaccumulation and excessive concentration of control that becomes a problem for even the most well-intentioned organizations.

Secession rights are crucial for healthy cell division.

===Was Marx Wrong?
Saint IGNUcius (Richard Stallman) claims we must protect Users, not Developers.

"'With free software, the users are in control.  Most of the time, users want interoperability, and when the software is free, they get what they want.  With non-free software, the developer controls the users.  The developer permits interoperability when that suits the developer; what the users want is beside the point.'" -- "Three Minutes with Richard Stallman" http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,137098-c,freeware/article.html

In his model, it is the consumers, not the workers who should control the Means of Production.

When consumers own the Means of Production and accept goods and services as the return on investment, work is no longer considered a goal in itself, but returns to it's natural position as a hurdle to be minimized.

Trading promises early allows us to swap skills and specialize without passing tokens even while solving the "simultaneous coincidence of wants" problem that faces typical barter.

Treating profit as an investment from the payer causes the property ownership of the organization to be automatically distributed to those who paid for that growth and need the results.

Secession keeps control localized as groups grow and need to split.

Profit is reduced as consumers gain property.
