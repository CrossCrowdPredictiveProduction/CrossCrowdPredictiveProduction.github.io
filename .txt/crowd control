==                Crowd Control

Crowd Control is a transitional development strategy designed to help us own and govern the physical assets required to continually reproduce the crucial goods and services required to meet our basic human needs.

Similar to how the GNU GPL uses copyright to protect Users in the immaterial realm, we have created a Terms of Operation called the IOTA that uses property rights to protect Users in the material world.

The GNU GPL disallows exchange of a Product unless the 'Sources' are made available to that User at no more than the real cost of access.  Sources are [a crucial part of] the immaterial Means of Production.

To make this work in the physical world means the Consumer of a Product must somehow gain access to the Property required for that production, such as land, water-rights, tools, plants, animals, etc.

The IOTA achieves this by requiring some of the Profit a Consumer pays be treated as an investment *from* that payer, causing Property ownership in the growth of that organization to be continuously and incrementally distributed to those who pay for that growth.

We change the purpose of property by only selecting investors who are willing to accept the Product itself as ROI, thereby avoiding the selling and buying of the Product except for surplus.

This means all investors are really just Consumers pre-paying for future Products (goods and services).  But Instead of receiving just one round of production (as Crowd Funding usually does), these investors become the *real* co-owners of the land and tools and water-rights, etc. needed for that production and then accept the Product itself as the return for that risk.

We recognize every Worker is also a Consumer, and so each receives access to Property immediately, paying on a work-to-own basis, not with money, but by fulfilling Promises to work in the future.  Workers trade application of future skill for immediate access the Property required for food, housing, sanitation, clothing, etc. plus also receiving Promises from other Workers to apply skill on their behalf.




==                Intra Owner Trade Agreement

=== 1. Product is the owner's natural return
Each person becomes a co-owner when they pay with either Property, Promises or Profit.

Property means the physical assets such as land, water, plants, animals, tools, computers, etc. required for production.  Most these investors will actually just pay with money to buy Property.  Many investors will remain off-site, especially at first, but may move on-site if they qualify.

When you commit Property (or money), you receive Crowd Cache which vests immediately in legal terms, but of course does not create product until after the first round of production is complete.

Investors do not receive Profit, but instead recieve the Product as a natural side-effect of owning the inputs.  Just as the individual owner of a single Apple tree does not buy the fruit from himself, we also do not sell or buy the product since it is already in the correct hands (except surplus).

As co-owner of physical Sources, you are co-owner of the future product in that same amount.  For example, if you co-own part of a dairy under these terms, you own that same percentage of the milk, even before it is produced.

You don't buy that which you already own and you do not sell that which you need, so this arrangment cancels-out much of the usual need to transfer ownership, allowing us to avoid paying Profit and, more importantly, returns control to the hands of the people who need the results.

This is obvious for a single person owning a small productive resource.

For example, when you own an Apple tree, you own all the potential Apples from that tree as a side-effect of owning the tree.  You do not buy the Apples because they are your Property already.

Similarly, when you own part of an Apple orchard, you own your % of all the potential Apples from that tree as a side-effect of co-owning the tree.  You do not buy the Apples because they are your Property already.

You may invest as much Property or Promises as you want, but will probably only want slightly more Product than you can use directly (to protect against crop failures, for example).

Each investor becomes a real co-owner and receives the Product itself as a side-effect of that ownership.



=== Promises are a Worker's Investment.
Workers are treated as special kind of investor that receive Property on a "work-to-own" basis whenthey Promise to work in the future for other investors.  This Property vests incrementally and instantaneously as the work is completed, giving Workers immediate access and eventually debt-free ownership in all the Property needed to produce all their food, housing, clothing, sanitation, health care, etc. as long as Promises are fulfilled at the agreed quality and rate.

Many of these investors will be on-site from the beginning, living in temporary structures.  Skills must be proven, in some cases on a daily basis (to operate dangerous machinery, for example).

During startup, before production is started, Workers must also have access to some off-the-shelf solutions for on-site shelter (maybe even tents), sanitation, bulk food to cook shared meals and basic first aid.

Trading Promises before production begins allows us to specialize without passing tokens while also solving the "simultaneous coincidence of wants" problem that faces typical barter.  This arrangement also reverses the Worker's usual drive to perpetuate work.



=== Profit is the Payer's Investment.
If a group or any subgroup sells surplus, and Profit is collected, some of that Profit must be 'reflected' back to the payer as real ownership in growth.  So as the group buys more Property with that Profit, ownership vests to those who paid that Profit.  The payer is almost always the Consumer.

When selling any surplus, Profit may be charged against the payer, but some % of that Profit must be used to secure the Property and Promises needed to back more Crowd Cache issued as a 'receipt' issued *at the point of sale* based on projected costs.

This causes latecoming Consumers to incrementally gain access to the Sources of the Products they use by gaining real Property ownership in new assets purchased on their behalf by the current owners.
Treating Profit as an investment from the payer causes the Property ownership of the organization to be automatically distributed to those who paid for that growth and need the results, and also causes Profit to naturally approach zero.  But there will usually be some amount of Profit caused by changing tastes and new inventions.




==                Timeline

. Open discussion to find best location and size for pilot project.  Maybe farmland near a city to keep price low but make easy access for off-site investors and give us freedom to develop.

. Determine all Products (goods and services) to be offered.  Use permaculture principles to guide the selction of organisms used to produce all the food, drug, soap, cloth, timber, etc.

. Issue Crowd Cache for all Products, each backed by needed Properties and Promises.

. Write a crowdfunding pitch with all these details, including a video or two.

. Since no wages will be paid, the crowdfunding campaign will also include $1 spots (or whatever the minimum) that Workers will use to apply for employment.

. Attract Consumers to prepay (with money or Property) for locally grown Products.
.. This money is used to buy the Property required for production

. Attract Workers to prepay with Promises for locally grown Products.
.. These Promises pay for all the skills required for production.
