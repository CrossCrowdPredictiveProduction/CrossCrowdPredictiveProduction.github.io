Basic Outcome is another way to meet the goals of a Basic Income.

We use a set of ledgers to record the property and promises each group needs to produce and good or service they want.

Permaculture populates our the living and working areas with all the plants and animals needed for food, fuel, cloth, soaps, textiles, medicines etc.

Crowdfunding 'perks' are all the goods and services we will make with all this agricultural abundance.

Within this vertically integrated production mosaic we can "cancel-out" wages for most work by cross-committing to work for others in the future.

By fully owning the land and tools without debt, and by trusting commitments of future labor from others, we create a multitude of For Product industries that are even better than insurance - I like to call them 'assurances'.

For example, if you like Avocados you might buy the number of "shares" required to produce the quality and quantity/time of Avocados you predict you will want.

Each Share represents all Property and Promises required to make and store that Product. 

If you want the Avocados further prepared (such as at a restaurant), then you will also want shares in some of the on-site restaurants and may want to swap future labor (Promises) for that work too.

We can make the crowd-funding campaigns easy to understand by selling simple 'package' deals.

While the initial campaign might need several million to begin, we can source much of the tools and plants and animals for much less.
