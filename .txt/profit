Profit is the difference between consumer price and owner costs.

Profit measures the payer's dependence upon the current owners.

Profit measures the payer's lack of propertyleft.

Profit occurs when surplus is sold for price above cost.

Profit will usually separate from wages when property has multiple owners because the owners that do not work there will not want to pay wages higher than market price.

But when property has few owners, they can collude to claim all incoming payments are wages.

For example, a solitary owner can hire as many workers as he likes and then just claim all profit as his own wage.
