Given that these systems are wildly powerful, how can we better take responsibility for their design & deployment?

Tracking or Backing -- Tokens or Titles?

Tracking the property of others does not help us control production.

Let us instead issue and sell tokens to secure the Land and Tools and Work required for food and housing we must have.

0. Consumers gain Property when they prepay for Product.
    If you buy future product with money, you become part owner of the land and tools required for that production.

2. Workers gain Property as they fulfill Promises.
    If you buy future product with commitments to accomplish work in the future, you become part owner of the land and tools required for that production.
    This property vests as you as that work is completed.

1. Consumers  future Goods through their ownership in the productive Property.
    You own part of the goods and services produced by the land and tools and work.
    If you own a tree, you own the fruit - there is no purchase.
    If you own part of the orchard, you own part of the fruit.
    If you own part of the taxi fleet, you own some rides.
    Tokens do not flow, but 
    good and service 'instance' must be tracked to protect the group from

3. Consumers gain Property if they pay Profit when buying Surplus.
    You become part owner of the land and tools required for that production when you pay late.

I have been designing a new currency that reduces the need for counterflow in 3 different ways.

Most every City centralizes control through representative government.
Most Coins are just Tokens, while we want something more like Titles.
