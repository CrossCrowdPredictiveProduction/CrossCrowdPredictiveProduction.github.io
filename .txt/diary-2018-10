Recursive Sovereignty -- Using Property and Promises to Control Self and State

Future Goods and Services (FGaS) are sold to fund the purchase of land and tools.
Consumers become owners when they pay early (like crowdfunding, but crowdowning).
Workers become owners as they complete promises (vesting on a work-to-own basis).
Consumers become owners when they pay late (if paying profit when buying surplus).
Owners accept these good and service as the Natural Return on Investment (NRoI).

Good point.  We don't want inflation or deflation.

We want the "right amount" of money, but how much is that?

If the "right amount" has to do with our "productive capacity",

Then Land (in the old econ sense of all finite resources) should probably be part of that consideration.

0. Consumers gain Property when they prepay for Product.

    This property vests as you as that work is completed.

1. Consumers  future Goods through their ownership in the productive Property.
    You own part of the goods and services produced by the land and tools and work.
