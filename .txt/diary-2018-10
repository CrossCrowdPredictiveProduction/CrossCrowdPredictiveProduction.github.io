Good point.  We don't want inflation or deflation.

We want the "right amount" of money, but how much is that?

If the "right amount" has to do with our "productive capacity",

Then Land (in the old econ sense of all finite resources) should probably be part of that consideration.

Profit within this system is minimized by altering the flow of value over shared property and work commitments.

Please review the #RicardianContract and help with the #SmartContract if you have those skills or want to learn.

Tracking or Backing -- Tokens or Titles?

Tracking the property of others does not help us control production.

Let us instead issue and sell tokens to secure the Land and Tools and Work required for food and housing we must have.

0. Consumers gain Property when they prepay for Product.
    If you buy future product with money, you become part owner of the land and tools required for that production.

2. Workers gain Property as they fulfill Promises.
    If you buy future product with commitments to accomplish work in the future, you become part owner of the land and tools required for that production.
    This property vests as you as that work is completed.

1. Consumers  future Goods through their ownership in the productive Property.
    You own part of the goods and services produced by the land and tools and work.
    If you own a tree, you own the fruit - there is no purchase.
    If you own part of the orchard, you own part of the fruit.
    If you own part of the taxi fleet, you own some rides.
    Tokens do not flow, but 
    good and service 'instance' must be tracked to protect the group from

3. Consumers gain Property if they pay Profit when buying Surplus.
    You become part owner of the land and tools required for that production when you pay late.

I have been designing a new currency that reduces the need for counterflow in 3 different ways.
