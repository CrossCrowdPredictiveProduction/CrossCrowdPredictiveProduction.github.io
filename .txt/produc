Production turn inputs into outputs across time.

Production is continuous in nature, even without human intervention.

But humans consume the outputs of only a very few plants and animals.

We will replant our cities with those species to have food sovereignty.

We will swap skills to accomplish the work needed for that production.

We will share sources by crowd-owning the land, water rights, tools, organisms, fuel, etc.

We will use crowd funding to buy the property and work promises to gitter-done.

Anyone who commits Property or Promises becomes a real co-owner in a production arena.

All protected by the IOTA.

We will work toward vertical integration and eventually no longer pay interest or profit or any external fee.
