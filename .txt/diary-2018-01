2018-01-23: Migrating to git.GNU.io/FreeFarm/For-Product

2018-01-16: Notice most cryptocurrencies increase (inflate) the global money supply and are backed by nothing of actual value.  This is probably better than backing with debt.

We can back a coin with use value (actually the INPUTS [Property and Promises [or Sources and Skills [or Time and Money]]])by changing how it is issued.

The bitcoin algorithm awards coins in a mostly random and meaningless manner.

We will create a GNU coin that is backed by the land and tools necessary for production.

GNU coins are issued against property to be purchased in the future.

These coins are sold as though they were coupons against future product, but are actually titles of property ownership in the physical sources of that production.

"'The people come with nets to fish for potatoes in the river, and the guards hold them back; they come in rattling cars to get the dumped oranges, but the kerosene is sprayed. And they stand still and watch the potatoes float by, listen to the screaming pigs being killed in a ditch and covered with quick-lime, watch the mountains of oranges slop down to a putrefying ooze; and in the eyes of the people there is the failure; and in the eyes of the hungry there is a growing wrath.'" -- The Grapes of Wrath
