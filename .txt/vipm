A Vertically Integrated Permaculture Mosaic (VIPM) is a cohesive framework of all the sources required to continuously reproduce all the products we need, bound by the constraints of the IOTA.

The minimum size and complexity of a VIPM is bound both by the desired quality-of-life and by the completeness of the vertical integration.

The initial boot-up phase of may require workers live in tents and eat cafeteria-style meals that they prepare from bulk purchases until they have built the first of the permanent structures and before the agriculture is fully operational.

We will grow most of the inputs for food, soap, cloth, medicine, and building materials on site, but the "lead time" could be years for some products.  This means some of the investment money must be used to purchase these raw ingredients in bulk so the workers have basic food and shelter and first-aid as we work toward full vertical integration.

We will create 'core' businesses that are each co-owned by the future customers of that product.  For example, a chicken farm and tools for those who want eggs, a dental office and tools for those who want to insure their teeth will be fixed, a barley field and hops field and a brewery and tools for those who want beer, etc.  We can most likely use crowd-funding to start for each of these with the 'perk' being real co-ownership in that enterprise.

A variety of these core businesses to cover each need we have will allow us to exchange promises and thereby also eliminate the payment of wages in the traditional sense.

Each co-owner of the sources (such chickens, dental-tools, brewery) owns the same portion of the products (eggs or fixed teeth or beer).

This creates a solid foundation for the efficiency of scale needed to compete with traditional business.  Selling Product Futures will be rare for real needs since it is impossible to get the product for less than the real costs of production.

Once each core is full operational, we begin selling surplus to outsiders and charging profit against them.  This will cause the core to grow in size.

If we want the cores to remain stable as they scale, we will need to treat some % of the profit as an investment from the payer so that all consumers incrementally gain the co-ownership in the sources used to guarantee each product they need at the real costs of production.


==Bootup
Estimate the quantity and quality food, housing, sanitation, clothing, basic health-care, child care, transportation, etc. needed to support on-site workers.

Estimate the property and promises needed for that production and issue Product Futures toward those goals.

Sell those Product Futures for commitments of property and promises.

Part of the property must be the physical sources such as land, tools, organisms, lumber, wire, pipe, etc. needed to create and operate the VIPM.

The another part of the property must be 'bootup' goods such as tents, bulk-food, used clothing, first-aid kits, etc. needed to support workers until the agriculture is productive and before the permanent shelters are complete.

Depending upon the initial scale of the VIPM, we may also need to sell some Product Futures to secure commitments of external services that are not yet available on-site.

Potential workers look at the list of work needed and signup to fulfill the 'promises' portion of some Product Futures for which they have skills.  If a group of owners accept those promises, the worker is 'paid' by that group with Product Futures capable of generating one of the products he needs and, initially, by also receiving a portion of the bootup goods and external services needed until we are fully bootstrapped.

Once we have purchased the property and secured the promises, we can begin installing the agriculture and building the first of the shared structures.


==Outline
Potential users pre-pay to purchase land, water-rights, tools, plants, animals, etc. required to create basic goods and services they need such as food, shelter, cloth, soap, medicine, sanitation, basic health care including dentistry, optometry, etc.

Some pre-pay with money used to buy the sources while others pre-pay with promises to complete the work needed for that production.

After some amount of time, or after some series of events the Product Futures should vest more fully to the payer to allow for selling and/or renting of that sources or the products of those sources.

At some point, and under certain constraints, and mostly to resolve disputes, subgroups must finally be allowed to fork from the rest while retaining Source ownership.


....

    Incorporating for Product - Investing for Goods

Let's make new corporations owned by the Users of those Products.

We will organize groups to co-buy the property needed for production.

We will organize workers to promise to work in the future in exchange for ownership in the VIPM.

Each investor (whether of property or of promises) becomes a real co-owner in the VIPM and receives the product itself as a natural return for those investments.  Each co-owner of the sources is co-owner of the products in that same amount.  If you own .15% of a dairy, then you own .15% of the milk.

That leaves profit to be treated as payer investment in more sources - to become the real property of that consumer - causing him to incrementally gain the ownership in property that will allow him to finally stop buying that product late, but instead pay the costs early and then own the product as a side-effect of his property ownership.

This also  auto-distributes ownership to those who pay for that growth.

In this way we treat profit as misallocated property that must be 'reflected' back to the payer as ownership in sources (and cannot be just a payout of product or a break on the price) to complete a negative-feedback loop.


==Commentary
Capitalism has achieved much for humanity, but as any business scales in size it becomes clear the goals of that body conflicts with the goals of those it claims to serve.

As society becomes more aware of these troubles, corporations try to hide their goal of Profit because we understand Scarcity keeps Price above cost, and therefore striving to perpetuate Profit is the very basis of the conflict between Production and Consumption.

It may seem there could be no solution since those who traditionally Fund production demand Profit as a Return for the Risk they take.  They are operating under the paradigm of "Exchange Value" which requires some amount of scarcity to keep Price above Cost.

Let's re-examine our assumptions about who should Fund and therefore Own the Means of Production.

Let's look at the most trivial case of a single person owning a fruit tree for his own benefit.

He must pay all the Costs of ownership, including Wages if he does not do the work himself.

But he cannot pay *more* than Cost, for who would he pay it to?

Profit is defined as Price above Cost but if he does not sell the product, Profit is undefined.

This is all very obvious and might seem unimportant, but let's push the idea a bit further and see what happens:

Imagine now, instead of a single Funder-Owner-User, we have thousands of such investors pooling Funds toward an orchard.

By attracting potential Users to pre-pay for the goods they predict they will need, we can use those Funds to buy the means necessary for that production.

The Users and Owners will then be the very same set.  The product will not be sold because the ROI for the Risk is Product itself which they attain at Cost.

This solves the 'static' case where the number of Users matches exactly the output of that production.

But many of these consuming investors will want to over-own by some percentage to guarantee they have enough product at the round of each production.

We must do something with that surplus or it will rot.

We can sell those products for Price above Cost - as much as the market will bear - but to keep the organization owned by the Users of those products, we must treat the payment of Profit as an investment from the User who paid it so they also gain ownership in the Property needed for production.


==Imputed Production
Imagine a crowd-funded corporation where the only shareholders were the very consumers of that product.

Their ROI for taking risk would be to avoid paying profit - since the owner of an Apple tree does not *buy* the Apples from himself, but owns those Objectives already, as a side-effect of his property ownership.

There is no longer be "Vendor/Customer" relations to worry about since the vendor and customer would be one and the same!

The product is not be sold back to each owner because it is their property already, according to the amount they invested.

The owner of a milk cow does not buy the milk from himself since he owns it already as a result of his owning the cow.

A cooperative sells the product back to the supposed owners - thereby collecting !profit! and coming under the scrutiny of government restrictions (for example it is illegal to sell raw milk in some part of the US) and concentrating ownership and control into the hands of a few originators and/or a council.

If you invest more than you can use directly, you can sell that product to others under the strict condition (enforced by the IOTA) that any profit collected during that sale be treated as an investment from that payer - so the organization can grow in size while avoiding the troubles of centralization and overaccumulation that plague nearly every other endeavor that begins to scale.

There is no reason to worry about the workers - for that is who we are protecting, but we are protecting their ability to consume instead of trying to prop-up wages and avoid automation.

Wishing the machines would just stop (as John Henry) will become less and less of an option as the robots are coming to take the work away - and we can be *happy* about that if we are working on the right side of the equation!

Furthermore, even without robots, wages and profit will approach zero as the sources become cheaper, since there will be no way to stop willing workers from accessing those tools and thereby providing the solutions consumers seek.

Workers can invest more than they are able to consume, but it won't do them any good when the consumers already have sufficient ownership needed to protect themselves from workers who try to stop other peers from doing that work by blocking access to property needed for production.

Workers cannot protect wages through ownership if other consumers already have sufficient ownership because propping wages requires the worker be able to STOP other potential workers from accessing the property, and why would a group stop a peer from bidding to do a job especially since in some cases they might even do that work for free (gratis) because they see it as play.

Workers who invest and co-own more of the Apple orchard than they are able to consume will not be able to prop-up wages because the other co-owners will always have the option to do the work for themselves or to hire the lowest bidder.

When those workers have sufficient ownership in the sources for which they need the products, they will not be buying products from anyone, but will own them already, as a side-effect of their owning the sources needed for that production.

You may be tempted to dismiss this as simply a Consumer Cooperative, but this is absolutely NOT a Consumer Cooperative.

1.) Consumer Cooperatives *sell* the product back to the co-owners and collect a profit during that transaction that a committee then doles out in a Tyranny of the Majority fashion.

1a.) Imputed Production only sells product to non-owners, and only when there is surplus, and treats that profit as an investment from that payer - causing ownership and control to be automatically distributed at the point of sale back to the actor who was willing to pay for it. This system minimizes and nearly eliminates the trading of goods since the Property owner of does not buy the Objective, but owns it already as a result of his Property ownership.  The trading of goods will tend toward zero but does not reach stasis because of newcomers into the system (even just babies being born), and because people's interests change across time.


2.) Consumer Cooperatives are "Democratically Controlled" with one-member/one-vote.

2a.) Imputed Production is far more autarchic - where any member can 'fork' his portion of the Property and secede from the union or sell those shares if a split is attempted that is finer than reasonable divisibility (you can't both feed a single milk-cow grain and NOT feed that cow grain, but can divide a herd).

2b.) Each member has exactly as much vote power as he has ownership. If you own 11% of a roto-tiller and your neighbor owns 22%, then you have only half as much vote power in decisions such as "how often should we change the oil".


3.) Every Consumer Cooperative I know of is only concerned with buying products that were made by Capitalists.

3a.) Imputed Production is primarily about ownership and control of the entire tree of production - recursively, and works toward a Vertically Integrated Commons where we, the people, own the farms and factories and land and water rights and all the other Property and supporting Property required to reproduce those things.


Customers *already* pay all the Costs of production. We, the consumers, foot the entire bill. And we *also* pay Profit because we choose to pay late.

But if we could organize to pay early - to collectively purchase the Property needed to produce the products we need - then, we would still need to pay all costs.

But since we would own the products as a side-effect of our owning the sources, we would not be 'buying' from ourselves, and so COULD NOT pay Profit, for that final transaction would not even occur!

Profit is *undefined* when the consumers own the sources and accept the product as ROI.

Treating profit as the payer's investment allows us to safely include others while avoiding the typical problems of overaccumulation and excessive concentration of control that cause even the most well-intentioned organizations to finally fail to meet the needs of those they were initially formed to serve.

These owners do not buy the finished products, but own them already - even before they are completed - as a side-effect of their source ownership.

1.) Since the product is not sold, profit does not exist.

2.) Since the product is not sold, there is no chance for the government to collect sales tax.

3.) Since the product is not sold, there is no chance for the government to disallow that production (buying raw milk is illegal in many parts of the US).


==Another Outline
Attract middle-income Consumers to pre-pay for organic products and earth-friendly services.

Hybrid Option: Attract traditional Venture Capitalists, and pay them a % of profit gathered during growth.

Hybrid Option: Attract corporations like Pepsi, Nike, etc. who fund projects for Public Relations purposes.

Use part of the funds to buy cheap agricultural land without mortgage.

Use part of the funds to buy tools, plants, animals, water rights.

Use part of the funds to buy 'startup' needs of workers such as tents, bulk food, used clothing, first-aid materials, etc.

Attract Workers to build and operate the infrastructure by providing a "Basic Outcome" that covers all of: housing, all utilities (electricity, gas, sewer, recycling), transportation, and even food, water, medicine, clothing, comprehensive health care, child-care, education, - eventually all the things the corporations and governments currently control instead of smaller groups.

Occupy that land with tents to begin planting and building.
Will want to qualify as non-profit to avoid Property taxes.

Each Investor (whether committing money or work) becomes a co-owner of some Property within the VIPM.

Each worker receives the 'level' of Basic Outcome according to the quantity and quality of work they commit to achieve in the future.

Others commit their future labor in return for accepting your commitments.

If you want the studio apartment, a 5 minute shower, and very simple meals, you will not need to commit very much of your future labor.

If you want a 5-bedroom house want to shares in the clubhouse and more difficult meals, you will need to commit more of your future labor in order to compensate others for the extra work and land and tools

We do not pay wages, but that is ok since the worker does not need to buy most of the goods and services he needs.

We do not sell the Products (except Surplus) because all of that output is in the correct hands even before it is produced.


==Overview
Investors become co-Owners in the VIPM according to the value they commit as measured by the others in that subgroup.

Each co-owner of sources is the co-owner of products even before production is complete.  You might say they each own their portion of all *potential* products.  They do not buy the products from the VIPM, but must only claim that which is already their property.

For example, if you like milk and honey, then you will need co-ownership in cattle and bees and all other sourcess, (land, shelter, food, medicine), and the things needed to create those things (plants, animals, tools), recursively through the entire tree of production.


==Timeline
The vision of future product is proposed.
We must estimate the scale and level of vertical integration needed for that, balancing more immediate needs with longer term goals.
Then we write a 'recipe' for that production which includes
 A list of Property needed
 A list of Promises needed
We issue Product Futures against those Property and Promises.
We sell the Product Futures to purchase the Property.
Some will pay with commitments of Property, usually by commitments plain-old-money.
Some will pay with commitments of Promises by committing to work in the future.
Once we have all the needed Property and Promises, we can begin production.
After the first round of production, Products are distributed to each investor based on their % of ownership.
Owners with surplus Product have the option to sell to non-owners to cover the costs of that production.
Profit will be collected from the non-owners (as much as the market will bear), and is treated as they payer's investment toward more Property.


When workers commit Promises, they receive ownership in the Property of that which they needs the Products, not necessarily in that which they know how to operate or maintain.

So, if you want "Dental Assurance", you need co-ownership in the land and capital needed to perform dentistry, and then you 'hire' any Dentist to fix your teeth by cross-committing Promises to work on behalf of that dentist in return for his Promise to fix your teeth when needed.

Promising to work *before* production begins allows us to trade Labor between ourselves and never need to trade oranges with apples, since the co-owners of the Property own their % of the Product *already*, even before they are produced.  This is "Predictive Barter" - where we Property and Promises are preallocated to those who need the Products.


A functional VIPM will require a minimum "Horizontal Diversity" to allow us to 'pay' each other without needing to pass tokens.  For example, we buy/build a dentist office and the tools for simple dental procedures.  We must attract or train someone that can operate those tools, and who is willing to commit to do that work for the 'pay' of gaining co-ownership in the property for his housing, food, clothing, transportation, sanitation, etc. combined with commitments of others to operate that property for his benefit in return for his fixing their teeth.  Notice this fully replaces traditional insurance.

We will also want to work toward "Vertical Integration" to move away from the need to gather and spend external tokens. For example, we will buy grains and alfalfa at first to feed our chickens and cattle, but will also grow those plants to avoid the need to buy in the future.  Vertical Integration is a very long-term goal, and we won't co-own mines or factories right away, but will just buy off-the-shelf tools at first, while we are 'booting'.


Part of the initial costs for purchasing the property might be collected from middle-income consumers who are willing to pre-pay for organic goods.

Each person would invest just enough (either Money, Land or Capital) to cover the predicted costs of production for the amount of Product they each intend to use.

Each of these investors would still need to pay their % of the costs as usual, but since they would accept the Product itself as the return for that risk, there would be sale, and so Profit would not exist at all.

Labor will come from skilled artisans initially willing to work in return for food, shelter, basic medical care, etc. with a future payout of real co-ownership in the VIPM.

These workers must receive real co-ownership in the property for which they need the outputs, but until those facilities are functional, will need to be paid more 'directly' by being housed in tents and fed basic rations, etc.

Products are not sold when the users co-own the property needed for that production because the product is already in the hands of those who will consume it even before it is produced.

For example, you do not buy Apples when you co-own an Apple orchard because you *already* own your % of that product according to your % of ownership in the physical Sources (trees, land, water-rights, etc.) needed to produce those apples.

There is no need to pay wages when workers commit work before production begins because compensation comes in the form of co-ownership in the property they need combined with promises to work on your behalf from others in the VIPM.

For example, if you promise to pick Apples in return for someone else promising to pick Oranges and someone else promises to fix your teeth, and someone else promises to fix your car, etc., then we can enjoy the full benefits of specialization without the problem of double coincidence of wants caused by trading products late.
