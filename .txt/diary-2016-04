Destruction is good for business as usual.
This is an unfortunate but seemingly
inescapable part of how the world works.

If you get sick, a Doctor gets paid.
If your car breaks, a Mechanic is paid.
If your your teeth rot, a Dentist is paid.

Even if these workers have the best of
intentions, this arrangement pits us against
each other, creating one of the underlying
reasons business tends to seek and even
sometimes even artificially create scarcity.

Hmm, it may seem there is no solution to this.

But what if we change the order of operations?

What if we pay these workers *before* we need
those services?

Imagine we pay the Doctor, Mechanic and Dentist
the amount we usually pay to insurance, and we
pay it whether there is a problem or not.

In this case, the usual hope of destruction is
inverted to the natural and socially responsible
goal of permanent solutions.

The workers no longer hope you have trouble,
because they are paid either way, and if there
is no trouble, they can just relax - as it
should be.

I call this 'Assurance' instead of 'Insurance'.
