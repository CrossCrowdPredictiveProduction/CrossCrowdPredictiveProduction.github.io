A Stored Value Facility (SVF) is a form of prepaid electronic cash or card that can be used within the system of the SVF issuer.  The SVF issuer is known as the holder of the stored value.  Some electronic SVFs are also known as e-money.  Usage of SVFs usually does not require Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) or signatures.  The Payment Systems (Oversight) Act (PS(O)A) and its related regulations governs the issuance and management of SVFs.  Please access these regulations via the Key Resources links below.

An SVF may be a single purpose scheme or a multi-purpose one.  A single purpose SVF is an SVF that is, or is intended to be, used for payment only of goods or services, or of both goods and services, provided by the holder of that stored value facility.  Note that single purpose SVFs are exempt from certain sections of the PS(O)A.

When the stored value outstanding in a multi-purpose SVF scheme exceeds a prescribed threshold limit set in the PS(O)A, the SVF is regarded as a widely accepted SVF (WA SVFs).  Currently the threshold limit stands at $30 million.  The approval of MAS is required for the continued operation of this type of SVF scheme.  The PS(O)A defines WA SVFs as a stored value facility -

(a)        in which the stored value is held by an approved holder; and
(b)        in respect of which an approved bank has undertaken to be fully liable for the stored value.

In the event that an SVF becomes a relevant SVF, the holder is also required to comply with the PSOA-N02: Notice to Holders of Stored Value Facilities on Prevention of Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism.  The definition of a relevant SVF can be found within this notice.  This notice, issued in November 2007, requires holders to implement “know-your-customer” measures to establish and verify the identity of users. 

Approved WA SVFs
As of December 2016, four SVFs are approved as WA SVFs by MAS:

“EZ-Link Card” provided by EZ-Link Pte Ltd, approved on 31 January 2007;
"NETS CashCard" provided by Network for Electronic Transfers (Singapore) Pte Ltd (NETS), approved on 31 January 2007;
"NETS FlashPay" provided by NETS, approved on 9 April 2010; and
"CapitaVoucher" provided by CapitaLand Voucher Pte Ltd, approved on 2 December 2016.
Users, Operators and Issuers of SVF
For users or consumers of SVFs, a MoneySense article is available that provides an overview of SVFs.  Please see the link below, “Introduction to Stored Value Facilities: Making sense of stored value facilities used to pay for goods or services rendered”.

Operators of SVFs and holders of stored value may wish to refer to MAS’ Guidelines on Stored Value Facilities.  These guidelines promulgate best practices that that SVF holders are encouraged to adopt for their schemes.

"'Futures-backed currency ... replaces the top down control of interest and size of the money supply with a bottom up solution based on a traceable concrete value. Current monetary systems are difficult and awkward to stabilize while accounting for delayed and conflicting information, political interference and the changing demands of international trade and local businesses. With futures-backed currency, punitive forms of inflation are eliminated and economic growth becomes a natural industry-specific attribute, while changes to the size of the money supply become an automatic stabilizer. This currency, backed by the future delivery of a product or service, satisfies all the needed functions of money. It is a store of value, a medium of exchange, and a unit of account. It is in theory better at these functions than traditional fiat currencies like the Euro, popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, and even gold backed cryptocurrencies such as Digix.'"

"'The scheme outlined in the Sams white paper uses two different types of token on the same blockchain, called coins and shares, respectively. Coins are designed to have a stable value over time. Shares, which fluctuate in value, entitle the owner to a share of the system's future seigniorage profits.'" -- ArsTechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/04/why-investors-pumped-133-million-into-stablecoin-basis

We can use these funds to buy undeveloped land and tools without debt.

We can move the homeless there immediately and begin building a self-sustaining city using permaculture to grow all food and low-tech solutions to supply housing and energy.

Those who can work receive 'upgrades', eliminating the need to use money or rent.

Eventually all work and other costs must be supplied from within the city, by those citizens and their tools.

If some consumers will pay early for some goods and services, we can build private cities where we can eventually also live rent free.

"'... block producers on these anarchic networks are rewarded an endogenous value (seigniorage) to secure the network.

Creating systemically important cryptocurrency networks is likely the most ironic phenomenon to have arisen from an anarchic experiment started on a mailing list ten years ago.  Yet here we are.

If you are interested in participating in something that doesn’t merely enrich existing coin holders at the expense of society and the environment, highly recommend reading Ray Dillinger’s recent interview and also looking into dFMI.  And then circle back to the CBDC report from the BIS this past March.'"

CityCoin aligns stakeholder interests.

📈 Continuous Fundraising becomes a direct form of voting.  You simply prepay for the 'public' goods or services you want.

🏄 Fully liquid. The bonding curve guarantees that an investor will always be able to buy or sell their FAIRs (though not necessarily at the price they wants), even in the absence of being listed on the public market.

🌳Attractive to long-term investors. By construction, the DAT limits short-term speculators and attracts long-term investors.

💲 FAIRs are a claim on future products handled by the DAT and should be valued as such.

💬 Governance is direct individual control which is easy to delegate or revoke.


MINT:
When consumer pays early for future products.  (Investing)
When consumer pays late for current products.  (paying Profit when buying surplus Product)

BURN:
When owners remove this agreement from land or tools.

sponsored burning creating incentives for investors to buy and hold DATTs while funding the beneficiary organization until it starts generating revenues.

pre-revenue . Before the organization generates any product, the price appreciation of DATTs is due to investors’ speculation in anticipation of future product.

post-revenues . Once products begin to flow, the price appreciation of DATTs starts being driven by the products generated by the organization.

It makes sense for consumers to be owners when they can predict they will need that good or service.

Management can be kept separate from ownership just as shareholders do now, by hiring managers.

Holding the Means of Production (Land and Tools) because you need the results creates a strange economy where each good and service is pre-allocated to those who predict they will need it.

This eliminates the final sale of that good or service (except when selling surplus to others), causing profit and possibly even sales tax to disappear.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imputed_rent

Rent is a massive flow of value from the poor to the rich.

But rent is 0 when occupier is owner.

We can sell a coin backed by the Use Value of real estate,
and use those funds to buy that Land and some Tools to
start new societies owned and operated by their citizens.
