A few ideas to make washing easier:

Fit both laundry and dish washers with containers to automatically dispense a configurable amount of soap 

Multiple laundry chutes (3 may be enough) allows the user to pre-sort clothes.

Each chute dumps onto a large tray that dumps into the washer when a sufficient weight is reached and if the washer is not already busy.
