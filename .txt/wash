A few ideas to make washing easier:

Fit laundry and dish washers with containers that automatically dispense a configurable amount of soap.

==Dishes
Multiple trays


==Clothes
Multiple laundry baskets (maybe around 5) let the user sort clothes early.

When each basket reaches a weight limit, and if another load is not running, it is dumped in the washer.

The washer dumps into the dryer when finished.

The dryer dumps into a counterbalanced dumb-waiter, delivering the clothes back to the correct room.

==House
VacBot: industrial-strength cleaning unit to cleans floors and lower walls.  Optional wet-vac steam pass.  Smaller version cleans countertops.
