BreadLandia is a game and experiment in physical production.

The electronic version searches real-estate listings to create maps of available farmland.

Cells on each grid represent one square-foot of land is 'unlocked' when the builtin micro-crowdfunding purchases the real estate.

Tools, shelters, factories, roads, hospitals, plants, animals, etc. can also be bought or built.

One acre has 43,560 sqare feet and farmland is around $4,000/acre now, so let's say $4,356/acre gives us about 10 Cells for $1, but other real costs such as water rights, fees, taxes, etc, might put us at 10 times that price, so let's say 99cents buys 1 square foot.

Owners must pay taxes and fees of containing governments.
