The Cross Crowd Predictive Production Intra Owner Trade Agreement has these constraints:
1. Product is the owner's natural return:
This means the owner of inputs is the owner of outputs automatically.

2. Sources are the consumer's investment:
This means you may invest physical assets such as land, water-rights, tools, etc.

3. Promises are the worker's investment:
This means you may invest future labor if those accepting these promises consider you qualified.

4. Profit is a product buyer's investment:
This means we will charge profit against those who buy surplus product but then treat that profit as the payer's investment.

5. Property division is the owner's right:
This means subgroups may split from the group at any time and for any reason without punishment.

This is Cross Crowd Predictive Production.
