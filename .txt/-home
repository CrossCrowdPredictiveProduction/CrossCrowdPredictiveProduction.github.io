1. The upper-half of this picture represents the usual vision of a "worker owned" system, where each stage of production, from left to right, is wholly owned by the person who knows how to operate that stage.

The product must be sold at each stage.

For example, the farmer owns the wheat field, and so sells the wheat to the miller who owns the mill, who sells the flour to the baker who owns the bakery who sells the bread back to the farmer and miller.

2. The lower-half shows each stage partially owned by each person who needs the final product.

The product is never sold because it is already the property of the person who needs it.

So in this scenario, the farmer, miller and baker each own 1/3 of the wheat field (and so 1/3 of the wheat), 1/3 of the mill (and so 1/3 of the flour) and 1/3 of the bakery (and so 1/3 of the bread) without any selling/buying of those goods.

This safely eliminates profit for those in that group, for that product, since the owners accept the product itself as the natural return on investment, and there is no sale, and so price == cost and profit is undefined.

When combined with a strategy of cross-committing work promises toward future production, we can reduce and nearly eliminate the perceived need for money even with full voluntary specialization and economy of scale.

This is Cross Crowd Predictive Production.
