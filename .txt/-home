The GNU GPL insures user freedom in the immaterial realm by guaranteeing access to virtual sources.

The CCPP IOTA insure user freedom in the material realm by guaranteeing access to physical sources.

1. When users own the sources of production, they own the products automatically.

2. Investors receive real ownership for the purpose of accepting the product as the return on those investments.

3. Workers who promise to work in the future also receive real ownership for the purpose of accepting the product as the return on those investments.

4. Profit is treated as an investment from the payer to stablize the system as it scales in size by automatically distributing control to those willing to pay for that growth.

5. Any subgroup may secede for any reason while retaining their ownership so control remains localized even as the entity scales to cover the earth.

This is Cross Crowd Predictive Production.
