When you own For Product, there is no sale.

You accept the product itself as the return on investment.

Each investor owns the same % of the product as they own of the corporation.

Property ownership For Product preallocates goods and services without sale.

Just as when you own a tree, you own the fruit,
When you co-own a forest, you co-own the fruit.

Profit does not exist because purchase does not occur.

Ownership For Product also changes how work is allocated and traded.

Promises of future labor are traded for access to property on a work-to-own basis.

When people invest For Product, it looks like a 0% interest loan.

For example, when crowdfunding campaigns payout with product, even the principal is not repaid.

We can extend this idea for P2P ownership of the land and tools to produce goods and services we need.
