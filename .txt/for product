The For Product business model alters the flow of value within that business by incrementally distributing property to those who need the products of that property, while work and profit are safely minimized.


== Terms of Operation
1. Money becomes Property
2. Promises become Property
3. Property becomes Product
4. Profit becomes Property


==== 1. Money becomes Property
Similar to crowdfunding, consumers prepay for future goods and services, but they become the real property owners in the land and tools purchased for that production.


==== 2. Promises become Property.
Every worker is a consumer who needs property for that same reason.

Workers commit promises to work in the future in return for access to property that vests as that work is completed.

The worker can use the vested property as collateral to access more expensive tools or housing.

* For our own safety, everyone must at least have access to very basic shelter and sanitation.


==== 3. Property becomes Product
These owners accept the product itself as the natural return on investment.

They do not buy the product from the collective others (as a consumer cooperative would), but accept the finished goods and services directly as the return for that risk.  Each person owns his portion of the product as a side-effect of owning the property used for that production.  The price each pays as a consumer is exactly the costs each paid as a co-owner.  There is no sale and so profit simply does not occur.

These special shareholders are compensated by *avoiding* paying the profit they would otherwise pay if buying that finished product from other owners.

* Subgroups must be allowed to split the property and secede when it is realistically divisible.


==== 4. Profit becomes Property.
If an owner decides to sell some product, he may charge profit against those payers, but some of that profit must be invested for that payer toward the purchase of either: 1. property being sold from those with too much ownership, or 2. toward expanding those operations by purchasing more land and tools.

The stabilizes the system as consumers gain real property because they regain control of the production they need and avoid paying tribute for those future products.

* Profit should be collected from the payer since if sold below market price, middle-men will collect profit without reflecting any of that profit as the payer's property.

== Notes
When you invest in a For Product business, you become a real co-owner and accept the product itself as the return on investment.  You own the same % of the product as you own of land and tools required for that production.


Just as when you own a tree, you own the fruit,
when you co-own a forest, you co-own the fruit.

There is no sale when the owners are the eaters.
Profit does not exist when there is no sale;
the price each pays as a consumer is the costs
that same person paid as owner and the product
itself becomes the natural return on investment.


Paying others for work is a cost of production.
But every worker is a consumer needing Property.
So Promises become Property as work is finished.
This protects workers from paying consumer rent.

This 'preallocates' products to the people who know they will need them and eliminate sales in the traditional sense.  Profit does not exist because purchase simply does not occur.

Workers who promise future labor receive immediate access to debt-free property on a work-to-own basis.  This means workers gain real property ownership incrementally, as they fulfill work promises.

Each co-owner may decide some of the product they own is more than they want, and so declare it as 'surplus' to be sold to consumers with insufficient ownership.

The market sets the price when selling surplus, but some minimum % of profit must be treated as the payer's investment.  This causes those who pay profit to slowly gain property ownership in the land and tools needed to create future instances of that kind of product, and so eventually also avoid paying profit.


                ................

We, as groups of consumers, will crowdfund undeveloped land, tools and organisms For Product to finally regain direct control of production.

The minimum size of any group is set both by the quality of life target and upon the depth of grouping achieved - but also upon many other forces.

Those willing to live in tents and begin work will move onsite immediately to build the first central shared structure and begin permaculture installation of the plants and animals we need.

Today we pay all the costs of production and usually also profit when we buy products from other owners.

               ....


It is easy to assume the workers must own.
And it may seem consumers could never own.

When consumers bear the burden of ownership,
any person who qualifies may work instantly.

This same pattern is found in the GNU GPL.

Crowdfunding property For Product to escape usury on many levels.

Paying workers with property means they do not pay debt or rent for housing and do not pay profit for the goods and services they need.

Owning property For Product is imperfect assurance of future production.  This replaces the fragile, for profit, token-based insurance industry.

When you accept product as ROI, you do not buy; it is yours already.

This eliminates the final sale in a natural way - similar to how you do not buy nuts from yourself when you own the tree, even if someone else does the work.

This also changes the focus of the company from exchange-value to use-value.  Those who own For Product gain no benefit when market scarcity increases profit on that product.  It realigns production with abundance and makes robots our friends.

We use property to stop paying bankers, profiteers, landlords and merchants.

We 'reflect' usury as property to stabilize the system.

Treating Profit as the Payer's Investment does this for the consumer.

Treating Promises as the Worker's Investment does this for the worker.

It is not enough to pay workers or consumers with money or product.  In some ways it is worse than nothing at all, since it creates a temporary solution to the immediate issues of basic needs while perpetuating the fundamental problem of usury.


This model:
. Secures land and tools without debt.
. Secures work promises without debt.
. Realigns ownership with abundance.
. Returns consumers to the helm of production.
. Creates a Basic Outcome and Health Assurance.
