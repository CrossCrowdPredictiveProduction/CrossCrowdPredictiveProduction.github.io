The For Product business model uses the Intra Owner Trade Agreement to help groups control the production they need.

When you invest in a For Product business, you become a real co-owner and accept the product itself as the return on investment.  You own the same % of the product as you own of land and tools required for that production.

Just as when you own a tree, you own the fruit,
When you co-own a forest, you co-own the fruit.

This 'preallocates' products to the people who know they will need them and eliminate sales in the traditional sense.  Profit does not exist because purchase simply does not occur.

Promises of future labor are traded for access to property on a work-to-own basis.

Workers receive immediate access to debt-free property on a work-to-own basis.  This means workers gain real property ownership incrementally, as they fulfill work promises.

Each co-owner may decide some of the product they own is more than they want, and so declare it as 'surplus' to be sold to consumers with insufficient ownership.

The market sets the price when selling surplus, but some profit must be treated as the payer's investment.  This causes those who pay profit to slowly gain property ownership in the land and tools needed to create future instances of that kind of product, and so eventually also avoid paying profit.

We, as groups of consumers, will crowdfund undeveloped land, tools and organisms For Product to finally regain direct control of production.

The minimum size of any group is set both by the quality of life target and upon the depth of grouping achieved - but also upon many other forces.

Those willing to live in tents and begin work will move onsite immediately to build the first central shared structure and begin permaculture installation of the plants and animals we need.

Today we pay all the costs of production and usually also profit when we buy products from other owners.

               ....

It is easy to assume the workers must own.
And it may seem consumers could never own.

When consumers bear the burden of ownership,
any person who qualifies may work instantly.

This same pattern is found in the GNU GPL.

Crowdfunding property For Product and offering some ownership for commitments of future work allows us to escape usury on many levels.

Paying workers with property means they do not pay debt or rent for housing and do not pay profit for the goods and services they need.

Owning property For Product is imperfect assurance of future production.

                ....

Owning property For Product will allow us to accomplish our goals under our full control and with much less effort.

When you accept product as ROI, you do not buy; it is yours already.

This eliminates the final sale in a natural way - similar to how you do not buy nuts from yourself when you own the tree, even if someone else does the work.

This also changes the focus of the company from exchange-value to use-value.  Those who own For Product gain no benefit when market scarcity increases profit on that product.  It realigns production with abundance and makes robots our friends.

We can use property to defend ourselves against the profiteers.

But to keep the system stable, we must cause all forms of usury to be 'converted' or maybe 'reflected' as property.

Treating Promises as the Worker's Investment does this for the worker.
Treating Profit as the Payer's Investment does this for the consumer.

                ....

It is not enough to pay workers or consumers with money or product.
In some ways it is worse than nothing at all, since it creates a
temporary solution to the immediate issues of basic needs while
perpetuating the fundamental problem of usury.

                ....

This model:
. Returns consumers to the helm of production.
. Realigns ownership with abundance.
. Secures land and tools without debt.
. Secures work promises without debt.
. Creates a Basic Outcome.
. Brings production local.
