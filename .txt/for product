The For Product business model alters the flow of value within a business in these ways:
. Money becomes Property:   Investors become real co-owners with rights of secession.
. Property becomes Product: Investors are consumers paying early for things they need.
. Promises become Property: Workers are consumers who also become owners as they work.
. Profit becomes Property:  Consumers become owners if they overpay for surplus Product.

== Terms of Operation
==== 1. Money becomes Property
Similar to crowdfunding, consumers prepay for future goods and services, but instead of just one round of production, they become real property owners in the land and tools that will be purchased for that production.

This may sound like equity-based crowdfunding, but it is very different because here, each investor is taking a risk for the ancient reason that they simply want the results.

This allows the group to operate at zero Profit even while all investors are satisfied.  The compensation is the same amount as a For Profit investment as the consumer *avoids* paying profit for that product.


==== 2. Property becomes Product
Each investor accepts the Product itself as the direct and natural return on investment (ROI).

Investors receive the same value as from a For Profit investment, but as a reduction in price.

This protects them from Profit they would otherwise pay when buying that Product on the market.

The price each pays as a consumer is the costs each paid as a co-owner and there is no sale.

Each owns the same portion of the product as they own of the property used for that production.

* Subgroups must be allowed to split the property and secede when it is realistically divisible.


==== 3. Promises become Property
Every worker is a consumer who must also own Property to control the Products he must consume.

Workers can Promise to accomplish future goals, but the value of a Promise is discovered incrementally, as it is fulfilled.

So workers who commit Promises of future work receive access to the Property they need on a work-to-own basis, meaning it vests as that work is completed.

This replaces the rent or mortgage that would otherwise take most of the wages.

Vested Property can be used as collateral to gain access to even more valuable Property.


==== 4. Profit becomes Property.
Owners may sell Products, but some % Profit from that payer must be invested *for that payer* toward either:
A. Expand operations by purchasing more Property.
B. Buying 'excess' Property sold by other owners.

This is the same pattern found in the GNU GPL which requires users gain at-cost access to the "source code" whenever they receive "object files".

In this context, Products are the "object files", and Property is the "source code" which every consumer needs access at-cost to achieve user freedom in the physical realm.

For example, if you sell fruit under these terms, you must use some of the profit to:
1. Issue more Home Coin against property to be purchased in the future.  Or:
2. Buy Home Coin from those who are selling property already under these terms.

* Profit should be collected from the payer since if sold below market price, middle-men will collect profit without reflecting any of that profit as the payer's property.

== Notes
When you invest in a For Product business, you become a real co-owner and accept the product itself as the return on investment.  You own the same % of the product as you own of land and tools required for that production.


Just as when you own a tree, you own the fruit,
when you co-own a forest, you co-own the fruit.

There is no sale when the owners are the eaters.
Profit does not exist when there is no sale;
the price each pays as a consumer is the costs
that same person paid as owner and the product
itself becomes the natural return on investment.


Paying others for work is a cost of production.
But every worker is a consumer needing Property.
So Promises become Property as work is finished.
This protects workers from paying consumer rent.

This 'preallocates' products to the people who know they will need them and eliminate sales in the traditional sense.  Profit does not exist because purchase simply does not occur.

Workers who promise future labor receive immediate access to debt-free property on a work-to-own basis.  This means workers gain real property ownership incrementally, as they fulfill work promises.

Each co-owner may decide some of the product they own is more than they want, and so declare it as 'surplus' to be sold to consumers with insufficient ownership.

The market sets the price when selling surplus, but some minimum % of profit must be treated as the payer's investment.  This causes those who pay profit to slowly gain property ownership in the land and tools needed to create future instances of that kind of product, and so eventually also avoid paying profit.


                ................

We, as groups of consumers, will crowdfund undeveloped land, tools and organisms For Product to finally regain direct control of production.

The minimum size of any group is set both by the quality of life target and upon the depth of grouping achieved - but also upon many other forces.

Those willing to live in tents and begin work will move onsite immediately to build the first central shared structure and begin permaculture installation of the plants and animals we need.

Today we pay all the costs of production and usually also profit when we buy products from other owners.

               ....


It is easy to assume the workers must own.
And it may seem consumers could never own.

When consumers bear the burden of ownership,
any person who qualifies may work instantly.

This same pattern is found in the GNU GPL.

Crowdfunding property For Product to escape usury on many levels.

Paying workers with property means they do not pay debt or rent for housing and do not pay profit for the goods and services they need.

Owning property For Product is imperfect assurance of future production.  This replaces the fragile, for profit, token-based insurance industry.

When you accept product as ROI, you do not buy; it is yours already.

This eliminates the final sale in a natural way - similar to how you do not buy nuts from yourself when you own the tree, even if someone else does the work.

This also changes the focus of the company from exchange-value to use-value.  Those who own For Product gain no benefit when market scarcity increases profit on that product.  It realigns production with abundance and makes robots our friends.

We use property to stop paying bankers, profiteers, landlords and merchants.

We 'reflect' usury as property to stabilize the system.

Treating Profit as the Payer's Investment does this for the consumer.

Treating Promises as the Worker's Investment does this for the worker.

It is not enough to pay workers or consumers with money or product.  In some ways it is worse than nothing at all, since it creates a temporary solution to the immediate issues of basic needs while perpetuating the fundamental problem of usury.


This model:
. Secures land and tools without debt.
. Secures worker housing without debt.
. Protects workers as the consumers they are.
. Realigns ownership with abundance.
. Returns consumers to the helm of production.
. Reframes work as a hurdle to overcome.
. Creates Health Assurance through a Basic Outcome.
