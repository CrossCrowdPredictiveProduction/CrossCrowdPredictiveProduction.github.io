>> Ripio Credit Network (“RCN​”) is a protocol based on smart contracts and blockchain
>> technology, which brings enhanced transparency and reliability in credit and lending.
>> The protocol enables connections between lenders and borrowers located anywhere in
>> the world, regardless of currency. By reducing the traditional banking brokerage costs
>> and management fees, RCN aims to allow better conditions for both sides, creating a
>> better credit alternative than anything available today. By including an intermediary
>> agent (the “Cosigner​”), the RCN seeks to neutralize the lender’s credit risk and, in case
>> of a default, provide an alternative mechanism for managing the debt collection in the
>> borrower’s country of residence.
