artificial, design, info, real, synthetic

Virtual sources are the design, whereas physical sources are the implementation.

So DNA - as pure information - is the virtual part of an organism, but any single instance of DNA requires the physical realm to use, modify, copy and share that information.

All patterns of all kinds of art such as music, video, computer programs (apps), mechanical designs, etc. require a physical medium and sometimes energy to store and express that information.
