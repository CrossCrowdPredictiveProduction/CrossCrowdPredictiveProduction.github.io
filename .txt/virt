artificial, design, info, synthetic

Virtual sources are the design, whereas physical sources are the implementation.

So DNA - as information - is the design of an organism; though any single instance of DNA requires physical material to store that pattern.

Similarly, a song or movie or program must have a physical medium and probably energy to store and express that information.
