This substantially improves the functional coverage for the fuzzed code. The compact synthesized corpora produced by the tool are also useful for seeding other, more labor- or resource-intensive testing regimes down the road.'"

2018-02-25: Back to the penny idea... part of what I envision is what I saw when visiting Murmansk in the 90's with the kopek  hmm, when I arrived, maybe around 200 times less than a penny and falling. So if we could rescue this metal/medal from the grave we can repurpose a coin from the grave.  Dub ..  While there are countless brave attempts otherwise, it seems the most successful money references no real value, or, with debt-based money, negative value.

2018-02-25: ok, this is the game: we repurpose the penny....  meaning - well, ugh, it is difficult and incomplete.  Nothing is real.  But even so, metal is medal - a sort of stupid, bug-like satisfaction.

2018-02-20: So easily are we confused by those who benefit from our confusion.

2018-02-20: Almost anyone can easily be taught the basics of growing food, and yet the problem we face is more about sharing work.

2018-02-18: Reading Marshall Brain's cost analysis for a new system at ReplaceCapitalism.com

2018-02-13: Another example artificial scarcity:
"'
Nor is this all. The owners of capital constantly reduce the output by
restraining production. We need not speak of the cartloads of oysters
thrown into the sea to prevent a dainty, hitherto reserved for the rich,
from becoming a food for the people. We need not speak of the thousand
and one luxuries--stuffs, foods, etc., etc.--treated after the same
fashion as the oysters. It is enough to remember the way in which the
production of the most necessary things is limited. Legions of miners
are ready and willing to dig out coal every day, and send it to those
who are shivering with cold; but too often a third, or even one-half, of
their number are forbidden to work more than three days a week, because,
forsooth, the price of coal must be kept up! Thousands of weavers are
forbidden to work the looms, although their wives and children go in
rags, and although three-quarters of the population of Europe have no
clothing worthy the name.
