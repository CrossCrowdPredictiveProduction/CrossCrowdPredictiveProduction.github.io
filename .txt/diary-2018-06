Profit is not what you think it is.

There is a special case of property ownership where profit does not exist.

When the consumers of a product are the owners of the Means of Production for that product *and* if they accept the product itself as the return on investment, there is no sale, and so the price each pays as a consumer is exactly the costs each paid as a co-owner, and profit goes missing because the usual final transaction of purchasing the product does not occur.

This is a generalization of Economic Imputation where property ownership in the INPUTS is used to "pre allocate" the OUTPUTS to the very people who will use them.
This proves profit arises from the consumers' lack of ownership in the Means of Production.

Profit is UNDEFINED,
when product is ROI.

 Why is it so difficult for groups to own the property required to produce the few goods and services they actually need?

Nobody owns their home, and food is completely out of our control.

We must solve the puzzle of shared property ownership.

We could crowdfund the purchase of some farmland and tools to begin building a private city, fully owned by those inhabitants.

This would allow us to escape the debt burden and make food nearly free.

But we must own For Product to keep the system stable.

If you like milk you can own shares in a dairy and so receive that product at cost (you do not buy it, it is already yours).

This eliminates profit in a safe manner - by eliminating usual final transaction.

Just as the single owner of a single cow does not buy milk from himself, and so cannot pay profit - and even cannot pay sales tax.

This is a generalization of Imputed Rent.

"'
More formally, in owner-occupancy, the landlordâ€“tenant relationship is short-circuited. Consider a model: two people, A and B, each of whom owns property. If A lives in B's property, and B lives in A's, two financial transactions take place: each pays rent to the other. But if A and B are both owner-occupiers, no money changes hands even though the same economic relationships exists; there are still two owners and two occupiers, but the transactions between them no longer go through the market. The amount that would have changed hands had the owner and occupier been different persons is the imputed rent.
