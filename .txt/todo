.) Who are the investors and owners?
    Workers   become co-owners when they cross-commit Promises towork future production.
    Consumers become co-owners when they cross-commit Property toward future production.
    Consumers become co-owners when they ignorantly pay Profit toward future production.

.) How are investor-owners compensated?
    Investor-owners are entitled to Products based on their commitments of Promises, Property and Profit.

.) How is Profit used when surplus is sold?
    Profit is treated as the payer's investment so they gain co-ownership just as every other investor.

.) How do we vote within such a system?
    By treating the payment of costs as a vote, and the absence of such payment as a vote against so each person votes for or against building and maintaining "public works" by simply paying for those things or ignoring them.

.) How do we solve the Tyranny of the Majority when decisions are not unanimous and cannot be resolved through payment-based-votes?
    By allowing any "realistically divisible" subgroup to secede from the rest for any reason while retaining their portion of co-ownership. When the means of production cannot be divided realistically, the minority can probably sell their shares to the outsiders who are paying more than cost for surplus as explained in #2.

# Prepayments replace money as a system of time-delayed accounting.
# Workers prepay when they commit to work for future production.
# Consumers prepay when they commit money for future production.
# Consumers prepay when they pay profit when buying surplus product.

Mar-29-2013: Title idea: Vertically Integrated Life Assurance

Rethinking how to present these findings as a game system, I wondered about implementing a 'callback' interface.
Different organizational form are defined by how they implement the callbacks.
Here is a rough sketch of the idea:

//What is the minimum complexity and size of a functional group?
//Common answers: "Enough for some efficency of scale for a single PRODUCT"
MASS SizeAndComplexity()
{
    //Enough for some efficency of scale for all "basic needs" PRODUCTS
    //such as water, food, shelter, clothing, sanitation, transportation
    //This complexity is needed so workers can cross-commit PROMISES.
    return "A couple dozen acres of agricultural land and 50-150 people."
}


//Who makes the high-level 'steering' decisions?
//Common answers: "An elected committee"
GROUP Controller()
{
    //INVESTORS become PROPERTY owners with VOTE power based on % of ownership.
    //Subgroups may secede by splitting the Cell or selling their portion.
    return "Unanimous groups of OWNERS."
}


//How are Owners compensated for their risk?
//Common answers: "PROFIT"
VALUE OwnerCompensation()
{
    //Co-owners receive product as a side-effect of their
    //owning the PROPERTY needed for that production *plus*
    //the PROMISES required to transform that PROPERTY into PRODUCT.

    //Each OWNER does not buy the PRODUCT from the other OWNERS;
    //He OWNS that PRODUCT already, as a result of his commitments.
    return "PRODUCT as a natural result of PROPERTY + PROMISES."
}


//How are investors compensated for their risk?
//Common answers: "PROFIT"
VALUE InvestorCompensation()
{
    //Investors become OWNERS when they commit PROPERTY toward future PRODUCT.
    return OwnerCompensation().
}


//How are workers compensated for their time?
//Common answers: "WAGES"
VALUE WorkerCompensation()
{
    //Workers become OWNERS when they cross-commit PROMISES toward future PRODUCT.
    //When we say "cross-commit" we mean the worker receives ownership in the
    //PROPERTY and PROMISES used to create the PRODUCTS he needs.
    return OwnerCompensation().
}


//How are initial and continuing costs collected?
//Common answers: "Community Rent", "Club Dues", "Internal Taxation"
VALUE CostRecovery()
{
    //Each OWNERS pays their portion of PROPERTY and PROMISES for any PRODUCT they want.
    //This is simultaneously used as their VOTE to support or not support that PRODUCT.
    return "Each OWNER's portion of the PROPERTY and PROMISES needed for that specific PRODUCT."
}


//Who receives Profit when selling surplus?
//Common answers: "INVESTORS", "OWNERS"
PERSON ProfitSharing()
{
    //Profit is the Payer's Investment.
    return "The person who paid PROFIT when buying surplus."
}
