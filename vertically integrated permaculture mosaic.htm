A <a href="vertically integrated permaculture mosaic.htm">Vertically Integrated Permaculture Mosaic</a> <small>(<a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>)</small> is a loosely coupled collection of the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es required to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e all the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts we <a href="need.htm">need</a>, bound by the constraints of the <a href="iota.htm">IOTA</a>.<br/>
<br/>
You can think of a <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> as many in<a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ependent businesses each co-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by the future <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>ers of those specific <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts.<br/>
<br/>
Each <a href="invest.htm">invest</a>or attempts to <a href="own.htm">own</a> approximately the amount of <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es <small>(chickens, dental tools, cattle, bees)</small> required to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e the amount of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts <small>(eggs, <a href="heal.htm">heal</a>thy teeth, milk, honey)</small> they predict they will <a href="need.htm">need</a> in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike a cooperative, the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers do not <a href="buy.htm">buy</a> the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t from a central authority, but instead just claim the <a href="port.htm">port</a>ion they already <a href="own.htm">own</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Each <a href="own.htm">own</a>er must <a href="cross.htm">cross</a>-<a href="commit.htm">commit</a> the <a href="input.htm">input</a>s required for the ongoing <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion for all of the <a href="output.htm">output</a>s they expect.<br/>
<br/>
For example, each co-<a href="own.htm">own</a>er of a dentist office must supply the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es and <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>es <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed to keep the office operational.<br/>
<br/>
In most cases, each co-<a href="own.htm">own</a>er of such a dentist office will initially <a href="own.htm">own</a> just a small amount of the <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>able <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es as they were packaged with the <a href="purch.htm">purch</a>ase, and so will <a href="need.htm">need</a> to <a href="buy.htm">buy</a> from others.<br/>
<br/>
Each <a href="own.htm">own</a>er must <a href="commit.htm">commit</a> their <a href="port.htm">port</a>ion of the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es or <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>es <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed or <small>(more likely)</small> <a href="cross.htm">cross</a>-<a href="commit.htm">commit</a> unrelated <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es or <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>es that others are willing to accept in return for those <a href="commit.htm">commit</a>ments<br/>
<br/>
<a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es that are not yet <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts of <a href="vert.htm">vert</a>ical integration must be <a href="purch.htm">purch</a>ased from external <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es, and yet we should also put effort into <a href="buy.htm">buy</a>ing the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of those <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es so that we move closer and closer toward soverignty.<br/>
<br/>
For example, we might <a href="buy.htm">buy</a> feed for the cattle and chickens at first, but must plant alfalfa and grains to bring that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion local.<br/>
<br/>
That is an obvious and easy example, but we will incrementally target the more difficult <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts such as raising the plants or animals to retrieve fibers we will spin into thread, weave into <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>, cut and sew into our <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>ing.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will <a href="buy.htm">buy</a> wells and refineries to process crude oil into gasoline.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will <a href="buy.htm">buy</a> mines and forges to build heavy machinery.<br/>
<br/>
As more <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>s become operational, our goals can expand to much larger targets, for example, building spinnerets, looms, sewing machines and some of the tools to capture the power they <a href="need.htm">need</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Much later, when there are hundreds or thousands of <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>s, all that we <a href="need.htm">need</a> will be possible simply by dedicating <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty and <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>es to that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
The size and complexity of a <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> is bound <a href="bot.htm">bot</a>h by the desired quality-of-life and by the completeness of <a href="vert.htm">vert</a>ical integration.<br/>
<br/>
The initial boot-up phase may require <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers live in tents and <a href="eat.htm">eat</a> cafeteria-style meals that they prepare from bulk <a href="purch.htm">purch</a>ases until they have built the first of the permanent structures and before the <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture is fully operational.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually we will grow all of the <a href="input.htm">input</a>s for <a href="food.htm">food</a>, soap, <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>, <a href="medic.htm">medic</a>ine, and building <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ials on site, but this could take years for some <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts, so some <a href="invest.htm">invest</a>ments must be <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers <a href="need.htm">need</a> immediately to supply <a href="food.htm">food</a>, <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>ing, <a href="shelter.htm">shelter</a>, first-aid, etc. as we slowly increase <a href="vert.htm">vert</a>ical integration.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Bootup</span><br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<a href="sell.htm">Sell</a> those <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>s for <a href="commit.htm">commit</a>ments of <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es and <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
Part of the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty must be the <a href="phys.htm">phys</a>ical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es such as land, <a href="water.htm">water</a>, tools, <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nisms, lumber, wire, pipe, etc. <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed to create and operate the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The rest must be 'bootup' <a href="good.htm">good</a>s such as tents, bulk-<a href="food.htm">food</a>, <a href="use.htm">use</a>d <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>ing, first-aid kits, etc. <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed to sup<a href="port.htm">port</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers until the <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture is <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive and before the permanent <a href="shelter.htm">shelter</a>s are complete.<br/>
<br/>
We may also <a href="need.htm">need</a> to <a href="sell.htm">sell</a> some <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>s for <a href="money.htm">money</a> to <a href="secur.htm">secur</a>e <a href="commit.htm">commit</a>ments of external <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ices that are not yet available on-site such as dental <a href="work.htm">work</a>, extended <a href="heal.htm">heal</a>th care, long-distance travel, etc. until we scale large enough to provide those <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ices on-site.<br/>
<br/>
Potential <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers will look at the list of <a href="work.htm">work</a> <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed and signup to fulfill the '<a href="promis.htm">promis</a>es' <a href="port.htm">port</a>ion of some <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>s for which they have <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a <a href="group.htm">group</a> of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers accept those <a href="commit.htm">commit</a>ments, the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er is 'paid' by that <a href="group.htm">group</a> <a href="cross.htm">cross</a>-<a href="commit.htm">commit</a>ting <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>s capable of generating some of what he <a href="need.htm">need</a>s and, if during bootup phase, by also providing a <a href="port.htm">port</a>ion of the <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>able <a href="good.htm">good</a>s and external <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ices <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed until we are fully bootstrapped.<br/>
<br/>
Once we have <a href="purch.htm">purch</a>ased the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty and <a href="secur.htm">secur</a>ed the <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>es, we can begin installing the <a href="agri.htm">agri</a>culture and building the first of the shared structures.<br/>

Incorporating for <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t - <a href="invest.htm">Invest</a>ing for <a href="good.htm">Good</a>s<br/>
<br/>
Let's make new corporations <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s of those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts.<br/>
<br/>
We will <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nize <a href="group.htm">group</a>s to co-<a href="buy.htm">buy</a> the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed for <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
We will <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nize <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers to <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>e to <a href="work.htm">work</a> in the future in <a href="exch.htm">exch</a>ange for <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Each <a href="invest.htm">invest</a>or <small>(whether of <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty or of <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>es)</small> becomes a real co-<a href="own.htm">own</a>er in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> and receives the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t itself as a natural return for those <a href="invest.htm">invest</a>ments.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each co-<a href="own.htm">own</a>er of the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es is co-<a href="own.htm">own</a>er of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts in that same amount.<br/>
<br/>
For example, if you <a href="own.htm">own</a> .15% of a dairy, then you <a href="own.htm">own</a> .15% of the milk.<br/>
<br/>
That leaves <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> to be treated as <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er <a href="invest.htm">invest</a>ment in more <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es - to become the real <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty of that <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>er - causing him to incrementally gain the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty that will allow him to finally stop <a href="buy.htm">buy</a>ing that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t late, but instead <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s early and then <a href="own.htm">own</a> the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t as a side-effect of his <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>
<br/>
This <a href="auto.htm">auto</a>-distributes <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership to those who <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for that growth.<br/>
<br/>
In this way we treat <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as mis<a href="alloc.htm">alloc</a>ated <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty that is 'reflected' back to the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er as <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es.&nbsp;&nbsp;This must not be a <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>out of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t or a break on the <a href="price.htm">price</a>, for such do not create a functional negative-feedback loop.<br/>
<br/>
Capitalism has achieved much for humanity, but as any business scales in size it becomes clear the goals of that body conflicts with the goals of those it claims to <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
As society becomes more aware of these troubles, corporations try to hide their goal of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> because we understand Scarcity keeps <a href="price.htm">Price</a> above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>, and therefore striving to perpetuate <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is the very basis of the conflict between <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion and <a href="consum.htm">Consum</a>ption.<br/>
<br/>
It may seem there could be no <a href="solu.htm">solu</a>tion since those who <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itionally Fund <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion demand <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as a Return for the Risk they take.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are operating under the paradigm of "<a href="exch.htm">Exch</a>ange Value" which requires some amount of scarcity to keep <a href="price.htm">Price</a> above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Let's re-examine our assumptions about who should Fund and therefore <a href="own.htm">Own</a> the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
Let's look at the most trivial case of a single person <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing a fruit tree for his <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="bene.htm">bene</a>fit.<br/>
<br/>
He must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership, including <a href="wage.htm">Wage</a>s if he does not do the <a href="work.htm">work</a> himself.<br/>
<br/>
But he cannot <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> *more* than <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>, for who would he <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> it to?<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is defined as <a href="price.htm">Price</a> above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> but if he does not <a href="sell.htm">sell</a> the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t, <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is undefined.<br/>
<br/>
This is all very obvious and might seem unim<a href="port.htm">port</a>ant, but let's push the idea a bit further and see what happens:<br/>
<br/>
Imagine now, instead of a single Funder-<a href="own.htm">Own</a>er-<a href="user.htm">User</a>, we have thousands of such <a href="invest.htm">invest</a>ors pooling Funds toward an orchard.<br/>
<br/>
By attracting potential <a href="user.htm">User</a>s to pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for the <a href="good.htm">good</a>s they predict they will <a href="need.htm">need</a>, we can <a href="use.htm">use</a> those Funds to <a href="buy.htm">buy</a> the means necessary for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="user.htm">User</a>s and <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers will then be the very same set.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t will not be <a href="sold.htm">sold</a> because the ROI for the Risk is <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t itself which they attain at <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
This <a href="solv.htm">solv</a>es the 'static' case where the number of <a href="user.htm">User</a>s matches exactly the <a href="output.htm">output</a> of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
But many of these <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>ing <a href="invest.htm">invest</a>ors will want to over-<a href="own.htm">own</a> by some percentage to guarantee they have enough <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t at the round of each <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
We must do something with that <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a> or it will rot.<br/>
<br/>
We can <a href="sell.htm">sell</a> those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts for <a href="price.htm">Price</a> above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> - as much as the market will bear - but to keep the <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by the <a href="user.htm">User</a>s of those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts, we must treat the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as an <a href="invest.htm">invest</a>ment from the <a href="user.htm">User</a> who paid it so they also gain <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed for <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Another Outline</span><br/>

<br/>
Each <a href="work.htm">work</a>er receives the 'level' of Basic Outcome according to the quantity and quality of <a href="work.htm">work</a> they <a href="commit.htm">commit</a> to achieve in the future.<br/>

<br/>
If you want a 5-bedroom house want to shares in the clubhouse and more difficult meals, you will <a href="need.htm">need</a> to <a href="commit.htm">commit</a> more of your future <a href="labor.htm">labor</a> in order to compensate others for the extra <a href="work.htm">work</a> and land and tools<br/>
<br/>
We do not <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>s, but that is ok since the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er does not <a href="need.htm">need</a> to <a href="buy.htm">buy</a> most of the <a href="good.htm">good</a>s and <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ices he <a href="need.htm">need</a>s.<br/>

Each co-<a href="own.htm">own</a>er of <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es is the co-<a href="own.htm">own</a>er of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts even before <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion is complete.&nbsp;&nbsp;You might say they each <a href="own.htm">own</a> their <a href="port.htm">port</a>ion of all *potential* <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts.&nbsp;&nbsp;They do not <a href="buy.htm">buy</a> the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts from the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>, but must only claim that which is already their <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty.<br/>
<br/>
For example, if you like milk and honey, then you will <a href="need.htm">need</a> co-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in cattle and bees and all other <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>ess, <small>(land, <a href="shelter.htm">shelter</a>, <a href="food.htm">food</a>, <a href="medic.htm">medic</a>ine)</small>, and the things <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed to create those things <small>(plants, animals, tools)</small>, recursively through the entire tree of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Timeline</span><br/>
The vision of future <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is proposed.<br/>
We must estimate the scale and level of <a href="vert.htm">vert</a>ical integration <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed for that, balancing more immediate <a href="need.htm">need</a>s with longer term goals.<br/>
Then we write a 'recipe' for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion which includes<br/>
&nbsp;A list of <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed<br/>
&nbsp;A list of <a href="promis.htm">Promis</a>es <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed<br/>
We issue <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>s against those <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty and <a href="promis.htm">Promis</a>es.<br/>
We <a href="sell.htm">sell</a> the <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>s to <a href="purch.htm">purch</a>ase the <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty.<br/>
Some will <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> with <a href="commit.htm">commit</a>ments of <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty, usually by <a href="commit.htm">commit</a>ments plain-old-<a href="money.htm">money</a>.<br/>
Some will <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> with <a href="commit.htm">commit</a>ments of <a href="promis.htm">Promis</a>es by <a href="commit.htm">commit</a>ting to <a href="work.htm">work</a> in the future.<br/>
Once we have all the <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty and <a href="promis.htm">Promis</a>es, we can begin <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
After the first round of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts are distributed to each <a href="invest.htm">invest</a>or based on their % of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>
<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers with <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t have the option to <a href="sell.htm">sell</a> to non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers to cover the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> will be collected from the non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers <small>(as much as the market will bear)</small>, and is treated as they <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er's <a href="invest.htm">invest</a>ment toward more <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers <a href="commit.htm">commit</a> <a href="promis.htm">Promis</a>es, they receive <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty of that which they <a href="need.htm">need</a>s the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts, not necessarily in that which they know how to operate or maintain.<br/>
<br/>
So, if you want "Dental <a href="assur.htm">Assur</a>ance", you <a href="need.htm">need</a> co-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the land and capital <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed to perform dentistry, and then you 'hire' any Dentist to fix your teeth by <a href="cross.htm">cross</a>-<a href="commit.htm">commit</a>ting <a href="promis.htm">Promis</a>es to <a href="work.htm">work</a> on behalf of that dentist in return for his <a href="promis.htm">Promis</a>e to fix your teeth when <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed.<br/>

<a href="promis.htm">Promis</a>ing to <a href="work.htm">work</a> *before* <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion begins allows us to <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e <a href="labor.htm">Labor</a> between ourselves and never <a href="need.htm">need</a> to <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e oranges with apples, since the co-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of the <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a> their % of the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t *already*, even before they are <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is "Predictive Barter" - where we <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty and <a href="promis.htm">Promis</a>es are pre<a href="alloc.htm">alloc</a>ated to those who <a href="need.htm">need</a> the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A functional <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> will require a minimum "Horizontal Diversity" to allow us to '<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>' each other without <a href="need.htm">need</a>ing to pass tokens.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, we <a href="buy.htm">buy</a>/build a dentist office and the tools for simple dental procedures.&nbsp;&nbsp;We must attract or train someone that can operate those tools, and who is willing to <a href="commit.htm">commit</a> to do that <a href="work.htm">work</a> for the '<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>' of gaining co-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty for his housing, <a href="food.htm">food</a>, <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a>ing, <a href="trans.htm">trans</a><a href="port.htm">port</a>ation, <a href="sani.htm">sani</a>tation, etc. combined with <a href="commit.htm">commit</a>ments of others to operate that <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty for his <a href="bene.htm">bene</a>fit in return for his fixing their teeth.&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice this fully replaces <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itional <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance.<br/>
<br/>
We will also want to <a href="work.htm">work</a> toward "<a href="vert.htm">Vert</a>ical Integration" to move away from the <a href="need.htm">need</a> to <a href="gath.htm">gath</a>er and spend external tokens. For example, we will <a href="buy.htm">buy</a> grains and alfalfa at first to feed our chickens and cattle, but will also grow those plants to avoid the <a href="need.htm">need</a> to <a href="buy.htm">buy</a> in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="vert.htm">Vert</a>ical Integration is a very long-term goal, and we won't co-<a href="own.htm">own</a> mines or factories right away, but will just <a href="buy.htm">buy</a> off-the-shelf tools at first, while we are 'booting'.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Part of the initial <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s for <a href="purch.htm">purch</a>asing the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty might be collected from middle-income <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>ers who are willing to pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nic <a href="good.htm">good</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
Each person would <a href="invest.htm">invest</a> just enough <small>(either <a href="money.htm">Money</a>, Land or Capital)</small> to cover the predicted <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion for the amount of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t they each intend to <a href="use.htm">use</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Each of these <a href="invest.htm">invest</a>ors would still <a href="need.htm">need</a> to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> their % of the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s as usual, but since they would accept the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t itself as the return for that risk, there would be sale, and so <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> would not exist at all.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="labor.htm">Labor</a> will come from <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>ed artisans initially willing to <a href="work.htm">work</a> in return for <a href="food.htm">food</a>, <a href="shelter.htm">shelter</a>, basic <a href="medic.htm">medic</a>al care, etc. with a future <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>out of real co-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>.<br/>
<br/>
These <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers must receive real co-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty for which they <a href="need.htm">need</a> the <a href="output.htm">output</a>s, but until those facilities are functional, will <a href="need.htm">need</a> to be paid more 'directly' by being housed in tents and fed basic rations, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts are not <a href="sold.htm">sold</a> when the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s co-<a href="own.htm">own</a> the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion because the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is already in the hands of those who will <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>e it even before it is <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed.<br/>
<br/>
For example, you do not <a href="buy.htm">buy</a> Apples when you co-<a href="own.htm">own</a> an Apple orchard because you *already* <a href="own.htm">own</a> your % of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t according to your % of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the <a href="phys.htm">phys</a>ical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es <small>(trees, land, <a href="water.htm">water</a>-rights, etc.)</small> <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e those apples.<br/>
<br/>
There is no <a href="need.htm">need</a> to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="wage.htm">wage</a>s when <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers <a href="commit.htm">commit</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a> before <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion begins because compensation comes in the form of co-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty they <a href="need.htm">need</a> combined with <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>es to <a href="work.htm">work</a> on your behalf from others in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>.<br/>
<br/>
For example, if you <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>e to pick Apples in return for someone else <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>ing to pick Oranges and someone else <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>es to fix your teeth, and someone else <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>es to fix your car, etc., then we can enjoy the full <a href="bene.htm">bene</a>fits of specialization without the problem of double coincidence of wants caused by <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ing <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts late.<br/>
