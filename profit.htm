<p class='main'><a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is the difference between <a href="consume.htm">consume</a>r <a href="price.htm">price</a> and owner costs.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> measures the payer's dependence upon the current owners.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> measures the payer's lack of <a href="propertyleft.htm">propertyleft</a>.<br/>
<br/>
It can be difficult and confusing to separate wages from <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> will usually separate from wages when <a href="property.htm">property</a> has multiple owners because the owners that do not <a href="work.htm">work</a> there will not want to pay wages higher than market <a href="price.htm">price</a>.<br/>
<br/>
But when <a href="property.htm">property</a> has few owners, they can collude to claim all incoming payments are wages.<br/>
<br/>
For example, a solitary owner can hire as many <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers as he likes and then just claim all <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as his own wage.<br/>
