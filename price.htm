1. An owner may set the <a href="price.htm">price</a> too high, but nobody is interested in that.<br/>
<br/>
2. An owner may set the <a href="price.htm">price</a> in the window of "just right" to be able to pay all costs while making some <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
3. An owner may choose to set the <a href="price.htm">price</a> as close to "at cost" as possible. This makes sense when the consumers of the Objects of that <a href="source.htm">Source</a> are also the collective owners of that <a href="source.htm">Source</a>.<br/>
<br/>
3a. If all the store owners, and all of the consumers of those imported items that were being serviced by the example truck were the collective owners of that truck, then keeping the <a href="price.htm">price</a> as close to "at cost" as possible makes sense because it only reduces their costs for trucking.<br/>
<br/>
4. Owners may set <a href="price.htm">price</a> to 0 and absorb the costs, but that is not sustainable.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Owners may set any <a href="price.htm">price</a>, but are realistically constrained on the bottom by real costs and on the top by competing owners and consumer demand.<br/>
<br/>
Real costs include any inescapable taxes incurred by the 'containing' government.<br/>
