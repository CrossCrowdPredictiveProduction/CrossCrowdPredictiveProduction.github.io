&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Version 3, 19 November 2007<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;Copyright <small>(C)</small> 2007 <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software Foundation, Inc. &lt; <a class="ext" href="http://FSF.org">http://FSF.org</a> ><br/>
&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br/>
&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preamble<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; The GNU Affero General Public License is a <a href="free.htm">free</a>, copyleft license for<br/>
software and other kinds of <a href="work.htm">work</a>s, specifically designed to ensure<br/>
cooperation with the community in the case of net<a href="work.htm">work</a> <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>er software.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; The licenses for most software and other practical <a href="work.htm">work</a>s are designed<br/>
to take away your <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom to share and change the <a href="work.htm">work</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;By contrast,<br/>
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom to<br/>
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains <a href="free.htm">free</a><br/>
software for all its <a href="user.htm">user</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; When we speak of <a href="free.htm">free</a> software, we are referring to <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom, not<br/>
<a href="price.htm">price</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br/>
have the <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom to distribute copies of <a href="free.htm">free</a> software <small>(and charge for<br/>
them if you wish)</small>, that you receive <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code or can get it if you<br/>
want it, that you can change the software or <a href="use.htm">use</a> pieces of it in new<br/>
<a href="free.htm">free</a> programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; <a href="dev.htm">Dev</a>elopers that <a href="use.htm">use</a> our General Public Licenses protect your rights<br/>
with two steps: <small>(1)</small> assert copyright on the software, and <small>(2)</small> offer<br/>
you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute<br/>
and/or modify the software.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; A secondary <a href="bene.htm">bene</a>fit of defending all <a href="user.htm">user</a>s' <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom is that<br/>
improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they<br/>
receive widespread <a href="use.htm">use</a>, become available for other <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>elopers to<br/>
incorporate.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>elopers of <a href="free.htm">free</a> software are heartened and<br/>
encouraged by the resulting cooperation.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the case of<br/>
software <a href="use.htm">use</a>d on net<a href="work.htm">work</a> <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ers, this result may fail to come about.<br/>
The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and<br/>
letting the public access it on a <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>er without ever releasing its<br/>
<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code to the public.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to<br/>
ensure that, in such cases, the modified <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code becomes available<br/>
to the community.&nbsp;&nbsp;It requires the operator of a net<a href="work.htm">work</a> <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>er to<br/>
provide the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code of the modified version running there to the<br/>
<a href="user.htm">user</a>s of that <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>er.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, public <a href="use.htm">use</a> of a modified version, on<br/>
a publicly accessible <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>er, gives the public access to the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e<br/>
code of the modified version.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; An older license, called the Affero General Public License and<br/>
published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is<br/>
a different license, not a version of the Affero <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a>, but Affero has<br/>
released a new version of the Affero <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> which permits relicensing under<br/>
this license.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br/>
modification follow.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 0. Definitions.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; "Copyright" also <a href="means.htm">means</a> copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>s, such as semiconductor masks.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; "The Program" refers to any copyrightable <a href="work.htm">work</a> licensed under this<br/>
License.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each licensee is addressed as "you".&nbsp;&nbsp;"Licensees" and<br/>
"recipients" may be individuals or <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nizations.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; To "modify" a <a href="work.htm">work</a> <a href="means.htm">means</a> to copy from or adapt all or part of the <a href="work.htm">work</a><br/>
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br/>
exact copy.&nbsp;&nbsp;The resulting <a href="work.htm">work</a> is called a "modified version" of the<br/>
earlier <a href="work.htm">work</a> or a <a href="work.htm">work</a> "based on" the earlier <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; A "covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>" <a href="means.htm">means</a> either the unmodified Program or a <a href="work.htm">work</a> based<br/>
on the Program.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; To "propagate" a <a href="work.htm">work</a> <a href="means.htm">means</a> to do anything with it that, without<br/>
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br/>
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br/>
computer or modifying a private copy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Propagation includes copying,<br/>
distribution <small>(with or without modification)</small>, making available to the<br/>
public, and in some countries other <a href="act.htm">act</a>ivities as well.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; To "convey" a <a href="work.htm">work</a> <a href="means.htm">means</a> any kind of propagation that enables other<br/>
parties to make or receive copies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mere interaction with a <a href="user.htm">user</a> through<br/>
a computer net<a href="work.htm">work</a>, with no <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>fer of a copy, is not conveying.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; An interactive <a href="user.htm">user</a> interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br/>
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br/>
feature that <small>(1)</small> displays an appropriate copyright notice, and <small>(2)</small><br/>
tells the <a href="user.htm">user</a> that there is no warranty for the <a href="work.htm">work</a> <small>(except to the<br/>
extent that warranties are provided)</small>, that licensees may convey the<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a> under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.&nbsp;&nbsp;If<br/>
the interface presents a list of <a href="user.htm">user</a> commands or options, such as a<br/>
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 1. <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e Code.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; The "<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code" for a <a href="work.htm">work</a> <a href="means.htm">means</a> the preferred form of the <a href="work.htm">work</a><br/>
for making modifications to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Object code" <a href="means.htm">means</a> any non-<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e<br/>
form of a <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; A "Standard Interface" <a href="means.htm">means</a> an interface that either is an official<br/>
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br/>
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br/>
is widely <a href="use.htm">use</a>d among <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>elopers <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing in that language.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; The "System Libraries" of an executable <a href="work.htm">work</a> include anything, other<br/>
than the <a href="work.htm">work</a> as a whole, that <small>(a)</small> is included in the normal form of<br/>
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br/>
Component, and <small>(b)</small> <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>es only to enable <a href="use.htm">use</a> of the <a href="work.htm">work</a> with that<br/>
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br/>
implementation is available to the public in <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code form.&nbsp;&nbsp;A<br/>
"Major Component", in this context, <a href="means.htm">means</a> a major essential component<br/>
<small>(kernel, window system, and so on)</small> of the specific operating system<br/>
<small>(if any)</small> on which the executable <a href="work.htm">work</a> runs, or a compiler <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e the <a href="work.htm">work</a>, or an object code interpreter <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to run it.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; The "Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e" for a <a href="work.htm">work</a> in object code form <a href="means.htm">means</a> all<br/>
the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed to generate, install, and <small>(for an executable<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>)</small> run the object code and to modify the <a href="work.htm">work</a>, including scripts to<br/>
<a href="control.htm">control</a> those <a href="act.htm">act</a>ivities.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it does not include the <a href="work.htm">work</a>'s<br/>
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available <a href="free.htm">free</a><br/>
programs which are <a href="use.htm">use</a>d unmodified in performing those <a href="act.htm">act</a>ivities but<br/>
which are not part of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e<br/>
includes interface definition files associated with <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e files for<br/>
the <a href="work.htm">work</a>, and the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code for shared libraries and dynamically<br/>
linked subprograms that the <a href="work.htm">work</a> is specifically designed to require,<br/>
such as by intimate data communication or <a href="control.htm">control</a> flow between those<br/>
subprograms and other parts of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; The Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e <a href="need.htm">need</a> not include anything that <a href="user.htm">user</a>s<br/>
can regenerate <a href="auto.htm">auto</a>matically from other parts of the Corresponding<br/>
<a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; The Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e for a <a href="work.htm">work</a> in <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code form is that<br/>
same <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 2. Basic Permissions.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br/>
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br/>
conditions are met.&nbsp;&nbsp;This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br/>
permission to run the unmodified Program.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="output.htm">output</a> from running a<br/>
covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> is covered by this License only if the <a href="output.htm">output</a>, given its<br/>
content, constitutes a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This License acknowledges your<br/>
rights of fair <a href="use.htm">use</a> or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; You may make, run and propagate covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>s that you do not<br/>
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br/>
in force.&nbsp;&nbsp;You may convey covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>s to others for the sole purpose<br/>
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br/>
with facilities for running those <a href="work.htm">work</a>s, provided that you comply with<br/>
the terms of this License in conveying all <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ial for which you do<br/>
not <a href="control.htm">control</a> copyright.&nbsp;&nbsp;Those thus making or running the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>s<br/>
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br/>
and <a href="control.htm">control</a>, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br/>
your copyrighted <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ial outside their relationship with you.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br/>
the conditions stated below.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br/>
makes it unnecessary.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 3. Protecting <a href="user.htm">User</a>s' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; No covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br/>
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br/>
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br/>
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br/>
measures.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; When you convey a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, you waive any legal power to forbid<br/>
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br/>
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br/>
the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br/>
modification of the <a href="work.htm">work</a> as a <a href="means.htm">means</a> of enforcing, against the <a href="work.htm">work</a>'s<br/>
<a href="user.htm">user</a>s, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br/>
technological measures.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code as you<br/>
receive it, in any <a href="mediu.htm">mediu</a>m, provided that you conspicuously and<br/>
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br/>
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br/>
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br/>
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br/>
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; You may charge any <a href="price.htm">price</a> or no <a href="price.htm">price</a> for each copy that you convey,<br/>
and you may offer sup<a href="port.htm">port</a> or warranty protection for a fee.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 5. Conveying Modified <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e Versions.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; You may convey a <a href="work.htm">work</a> based on the Program, or the modifications to<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e it from the Program, in the form of <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code under the<br/>
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a)</small> The <a href="work.htm">work</a> must <a href="carry.htm">carry</a> prominent notices stating that you modified<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it, and giving a relevant date.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b)</small> The <a href="work.htm">work</a> must <a href="carry.htm">carry</a> prominent notices stating that it is<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; released under this License and any conditions added under section<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "keep intact all notices".<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c)</small> You must license the entire <a href="work.htm">work</a>, as a whole, under this<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.&nbsp;&nbsp;This<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; additional terms, to the whole of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>, and all its parts,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; regardless of how they are packaged.&nbsp;&nbsp;This License gives no<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; permission to license the <a href="work.htm">work</a> in any other way, but it does not<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d)</small> If the <a href="work.htm">work</a> has interactive <a href="user.htm">user</a> interfaces, each must display<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="work.htm">work</a> <a href="need.htm">need</a> not make them do so.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; A compilation of a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> with other separate and independent<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>s, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>,<br/>
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br/>
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution <a href="mediu.htm">mediu</a>m, is called an<br/>
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br/>
<a href="use.htm">use</a>d to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's <a href="user.htm">user</a>s<br/>
beyond what the individual <a href="work.htm">work</a>s permit.&nbsp;&nbsp;Inclusion of a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a><br/>
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br/>
parts of the aggregate.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 6. Conveying Non-<a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e Forms.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; You may convey a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> in object code form under the terms<br/>
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br/>
machine-readable Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e under the terms of this License,<br/>
in one of these ways:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a)</small> Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a <a href="phys.htm">phys</a>ical <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <small>(including a <a href="phys.htm">phys</a>ical distribution <a href="mediu.htm">mediu</a>m)</small>, accompanied by the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e fixed on a durable <a href="phys.htm">phys</a>ical <a href="mediu.htm">mediu</a>m<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; customarily <a href="use.htm">use</a>d for software interchange.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b)</small> Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a <a href="phys.htm">phys</a>ical <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <small>(including a <a href="phys.htm">phys</a>ical distribution <a href="mediu.htm">mediu</a>m)</small>, accompanied by a<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long as you offer spare parts or customer sup<a href="port.htm">port</a> for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either <small>(1)</small> a<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy of the Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e for all the software in the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t that is covered by this License, on a durable <a href="phys.htm">phys</a>ical<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="mediu.htm">mediu</a>m customarily <a href="use.htm">use</a>d for software interchange, for a <a href="price.htm">price</a> no<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more than your reasonable <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of <a href="phys.htm">phys</a>ically performing this<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conveying of <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e, or <small>(2)</small> access to copy the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e from a net<a href="work.htm">work</a> <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>er at no charge.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c)</small> Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; written offer to provide the Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;This<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alternative is allowed only occasionally and non<a href="commer.htm">commer</a>cially, and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with subsection 6b.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d)</small> Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; place <small>(gratis or for a charge)</small>, and offer equivalent access to the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e in the same way through the same place at no<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; further charge.&nbsp;&nbsp;You <a href="need.htm">need</a> not require recipients to copy the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e along with the object code.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the place to<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy the object code is a net<a href="work.htm">work</a> <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>er, the Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; may be on a different <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>er <small>(operated by you or a third party)</small><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that sup<a href="port.htm">port</a>s equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of what <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>er hosts the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; available for as long as <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed to satisfy these requirements.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e)</small> Convey the object code using peer-to-peer <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>mission, provided<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you <a href="info.htm">info</a>rm other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e of the <a href="work.htm">work</a> are being offered to the general public at no<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; charge under subsection 6d.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; A separable <a href="port.htm">port</a>ion of the object code, whose <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code is excluded<br/>
from the Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e as a System Library, <a href="need.htm">need</a> not be<br/>
included in conveying the object code <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; A "<a href="user.htm">User</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t" is either <small>(1)</small> a "<a href="consum.htm">consum</a>er <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t", which <a href="means.htm">means</a> any<br/>
tangible personal <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty which is normally <a href="use.htm">use</a>d for personal, family,<br/>
or household purposes, or <small>(2)</small> anything designed or <a href="sold.htm">sold</a> for incorporation<br/>
into a dwelling.&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining whether a <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is a <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>er <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t,<br/>
doubtful cases shall be re<a href="solv.htm">solv</a>ed in favor of coverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;For a particular<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t received by a particular <a href="user.htm">user</a>, "normally <a href="use.htm">use</a>d" refers to a<br/>
typical or common <a href="use.htm">use</a> of that class of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t, regardless of the status<br/>
of the particular <a href="user.htm">user</a> or of the way in which the particular <a href="user.htm">user</a><br/>
<a href="act.htm">act</a>ually <a href="use.htm">use</a>s, or expects or is expected to <a href="use.htm">use</a>, the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t.&nbsp;&nbsp;A <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t<br/>
is a <a href="consum.htm">consum</a>er <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t regardless of whether the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t has substantial<br/>
<a href="commer.htm">commer</a>cial, industrial or non-<a href="consum.htm">consum</a>er <a href="use.htm">use</a>s, unless such <a href="use.htm">use</a>s represent<br/>
the only significant mode of <a href="use.htm">use</a> of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; "Installation <a href="info.htm">Info</a>rmation" for a <a href="user.htm">User</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t <a href="means.htm">means</a> any methods,<br/>
procedures, authorization keys, or other <a href="info.htm">info</a>rmation required to install<br/>
and execute modified versions of a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> in that <a href="user.htm">User</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t from<br/>
a modified version of its Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="info.htm">info</a>rmation must<br/>
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br/>
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br/>
modification has been made.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; If you convey an object code <a href="work.htm">work</a> under this section in, or with, or<br/>
specifically for <a href="use.htm">use</a> in, a <a href="user.htm">User</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t, and the conveying occurs as<br/>
part of a <a href="trans.htm">trans</a><a href="act.htm">act</a>ion in which the right of possession and <a href="use.htm">use</a> of the<br/>
<a href="user.htm">User</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t is <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>ferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br/>
fixed term <small>(regardless of how the <a href="trans.htm">trans</a><a href="act.htm">act</a>ion is characterized)</small>, the<br/>
Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br/>
by the Installation <a href="info.htm">Info</a>rmation.&nbsp;&nbsp;But this requirement does not apply<br/>
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br/>
modified object code on the <a href="user.htm">User</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t <small>(for example, the <a href="work.htm">work</a> has<br/>
been installed in ROM)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; The requirement to provide Installation <a href="info.htm">Info</a>rmation does not include a<br/>
requirement to continue to provide sup<a href="port.htm">port</a> <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ice, warranty, or updates<br/>
for a <a href="work.htm">work</a> that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br/>
the <a href="user.htm">User</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t in which it has been modified or installed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Access to a<br/>
net<a href="work.htm">work</a> may be denied when the modification itself <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ially and<br/>
adversely affects the operation of the net<a href="work.htm">work</a> or vio<a href="late.htm">late</a>s the rules and<br/>
protocols for communication a<a href="cross.htm">cross</a> the net<a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e conveyed, and Installation <a href="info.htm">Info</a>rmation provided,<br/>
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br/>
documented <small>(and with an implementation available to the public in<br/>
<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code form)</small>, and must require no special password or key for<br/>
unpacking, reading or copying.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 7. Additional Terms.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br/>
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br/>
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br/>
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br/>
that they are valid under applicable law.&nbsp;&nbsp;If additional permissions<br/>
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d separately<br/>
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br/>
this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; When you convey a copy of a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, you may at your option<br/>
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br/>
it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>(Additional permissions may be written to require their <a href="own.htm">own</a><br/>
removal in certain cases when you modify the <a href="work.htm">work</a>.)</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;You may place<br/>
additional permissions on <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ial, added by you to a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>,<br/>
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ial you<br/>
add to a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, you may <small>(if authorized by the copyright holders of<br/>
that <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ial)</small> supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a)</small> Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b)</small> Requiring pre<a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; author attributions in that <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ial or in the Appropriate Legal<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notices displayed by <a href="work.htm">work</a>s containing it; or<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c)</small> Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ial, or<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; requiring that modified versions of such <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ial be marked in<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d)</small> Limiting the <a href="use.htm">use</a> for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; authors of the <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ial; or<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e)</small> Declining to grant rights under <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>emark law for <a href="use.htm">use</a> of some<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e names, <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>emarks, or <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ice marks; or<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f)</small> Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ial by anyone who conveys the <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ial <small>(or modified versions of<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it)</small> with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those licensors and authors.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br/>
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Program as you<br/>
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br/>
governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br/>
restriction, you may remove that term.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a license document contains<br/>
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br/>
License, you may add to a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ial governed by the terms<br/>
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br/>
not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; If you add terms to a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> in accord with this section, you<br/>
must place, in the relevant <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e files, a statement of the<br/>
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br/>
where to find the applicable terms.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br/>
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br/>
the above requirements apply either way.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 8. Termination.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; You may not propagate or modify a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> except as expressly<br/>
provided under this License.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br/>
modify it is void, and will <a href="auto.htm">auto</a>matically terminate your rights under<br/>
this License <small>(including any patent licenses granted under the third<br/>
paragraph of section 11)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br/>
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated <small>(a)</small><br/>
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br/>
finally terminates your license, and <small>(b)</small> permanently, if the copyright<br/>
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable <a href="means.htm">means</a><br/>
prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br/>
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br/>
violation by some reasonable <a href="means.htm">means</a>, this is the first <a href="time.htm">time</a> you have<br/>
received notice of violation of this License <small>(for any <a href="work.htm">work</a>)</small> from that<br/>
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br/>
your receipt of the notice.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br/>
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br/>
this License.&nbsp;&nbsp;If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br/>
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br/>
<a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ial under section 10.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br/>
run a copy of the Program.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ancillary propagation of a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a><br/>
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>mission<br/>
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.&nbsp;&nbsp;However,<br/>
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br/>
modify any covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;These <a href="act.htm">act</a>ions infringe copyright if you do<br/>
not accept this License.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br/>
covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 10. <a href="auto.htm">Auto</a>matic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Each <a href="time.htm">time</a> you convey a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, the recipient <a href="auto.htm">auto</a>matically<br/>
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br/>
propagate that <a href="work.htm">work</a>, subject to this License.&nbsp;&nbsp;You are not responsible<br/>
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; An "entity <a href="trans.htm">trans</a><a href="act.htm">act</a>ion" is a <a href="trans.htm">trans</a><a href="act.htm">act</a>ion <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>ferring <a href="control.htm">control</a> of an<br/>
<a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br/>
<a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nization, or merging <a href="orga.htm">orga</a>nizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;If propagation of a covered<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a> results from an entity <a href="trans.htm">trans</a><a href="act.htm">act</a>ion, each party to that<br/>
<a href="trans.htm">trans</a><a href="act.htm">act</a>ion who receives a copy of the <a href="work.htm">work</a> also receives whatever<br/>
licenses to the <a href="work.htm">work</a> the party's predecessor in interest had or could<br/>
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br/>
Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e of the <a href="work.htm">work</a> from the predecessor in interest, if<br/>
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br/>
rights granted or affirmed under this License.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, you may<br/>
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br/>
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br/>
<small>(including a <a href="cross.htm">cross</a>-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)</small> alleging that<br/>
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, <a href="sell.htm">sell</a>ing, offering for<br/>
sale, or im<a href="port.htm">port</a>ing the Program or any <a href="port.htm">port</a>ion of it.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 11. Patents.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes <a href="use.htm">use</a> under this<br/>
License of the Program or a <a href="work.htm">work</a> on which the Program is based.&nbsp;&nbsp;The<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a> thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a>ed or <a href="control.htm">control</a>led by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br/>
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br/>
by this License, of making, using, or <a href="sell.htm">sell</a>ing its contributor version,<br/>
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br/>
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.&nbsp;&nbsp;For<br/>
purposes of this definition, "<a href="control.htm">control</a>" includes the right to grant<br/>
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br/>
this License.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-<a href="free.htm">free</a><br/>
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br/>
make, <a href="use.htm">use</a>, <a href="sell.htm">sell</a>, offer for sale, im<a href="port.htm">port</a> and otherwise run, modify and<br/>
propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br/>
agreement or <a href="commit.htm">commit</a>ment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br/>
<small>(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br/>
sue for patent infringement)</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;To "grant" such a patent license to a<br/>
party <a href="means.htm">means</a> to make such an agreement or <a href="commit.htm">commit</a>ment not to enforce a<br/>
patent against the party.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; If you convey a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br/>
and the Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e of the <a href="work.htm">work</a> is not available for anyone<br/>
to copy, <a href="free.htm">free</a> of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br/>
publicly available net<a href="work.htm">work</a> <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>er or other readily accessible <a href="means.htm">means</a>,<br/>
then you must either <small>(1)</small> cause the Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e to be so<br/>
available, or <small>(2)</small> arrange to deprive yourself of the <a href="bene.htm">bene</a>fit of the<br/>
patent license for this particular <a href="work.htm">work</a>, or <small>(3)</small> arrange, in a manner<br/>
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br/>
license to downstream recipients.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Knowingly relying" <a href="means.htm">means</a> you have<br/>
<a href="act.htm">act</a>ual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br/>
covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> in a country, or your recipient's <a href="use.htm">use</a> of the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a><br/>
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br/>
country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; If, pursuant to or in connection with a single <a href="trans.htm">trans</a><a href="act.htm">act</a>ion or<br/>
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br/>
covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br/>
receiving the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> authorizing them to <a href="use.htm">use</a>, propagate, modify<br/>
or convey a specific copy of the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, then the patent license<br/>
you grant is <a href="auto.htm">auto</a>matically extended to all recipients of the covered<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a> and <a href="work.htm">work</a>s based on it.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br/>
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br/>
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br/>
specifically granted under this License.&nbsp;&nbsp;You may not convey a covered<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a> if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br/>
in the business of distributing software, under which you make <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment<br/>
to the third party based on the extent of your <a href="act.htm">act</a>ivity of conveying<br/>
the <a href="work.htm">work</a>, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br/>
parties who would receive the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> from you, a discriminatory<br/>
patent license <small>(a)</small> in connection with copies of the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a><br/>
conveyed by you <small>(or copies made from those copies)</small>, or <small>(b)</small> primarily<br/>
for and in connection with specific <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts or compilations that<br/>
contain the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br/>
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br/>
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br/>
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 12. No Surrender of Others' <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; If conditions are imposed on you <small>(whether by court order, agreement or<br/>
otherwise)</small> that con<a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ict the conditions of this License, they do not<br/>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you cannot convey a<br/>
covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br/>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br/>
not convey it at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br/>
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br/>
the Program, the only way you could satisfy <a href="bot.htm">bot</a>h those terms and this<br/>
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 13. Remote Net<a href="work.htm">work</a> Interaction; <a href="use.htm">Use</a> with the GNU General Public License.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the<br/>
Program, your modified version must prominently offer all <a href="user.htm">user</a>s<br/>
interacting with it remotely through a computer net<a href="work.htm">work</a> <small>(if your version<br/>
sup<a href="port.htm">port</a>s such interaction)</small> an op<a href="port.htm">port</a>unity to receive the Corresponding<br/>
<a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e of your version by providing access to the Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e<br/>
from a net<a href="work.htm">work</a> <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>er at no charge, through some standard or customary<br/>
<a href="means.htm">means</a> of facilitating copying of software.&nbsp;&nbsp;This Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e<br/>
shall include the Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e for any <a href="work.htm">work</a> covered by version 3<br/>
of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the<br/>
following paragraph.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br/>
permission to link or combine any covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> with a <a href="work.htm">work</a> licensed<br/>
under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single<br/>
combined <a href="work.htm">work</a>, and to convey the resulting <a href="work.htm">work</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms of this<br/>
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>,<br/>
but the <a href="work.htm">work</a> with which it is combined will remain governed by version<br/>
3 of the GNU General Public License.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 14. Revised Versions of this License.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; The <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br/>
the GNU Affero General Public License from <a href="time.htm">time</a> to <a href="time.htm">time</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such new versions<br/>
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br/>
address new problems or concerns.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the<br/>
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General<br/>
Public License "or any <a href="late.htm">late</a>r version" applies to it, you have the<br/>
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br/>
version or of any <a href="late.htm">late</a>r version published by the <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software<br/>
Foundation.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br/>
GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br/>
by the <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software Foundation.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which <a href="future.htm">future</a><br/>
versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d, that proxy's<br/>
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br/>
to choose that version for the Program.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; <a href="late.htm">Late</a>r license versions may give you additional or different<br/>
permissions.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br/>
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br/>
<a href="late.htm">late</a>r version.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br/>
APPLICABLE LAW.&nbsp;&nbsp;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br/>
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br/>
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br/>
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br/>
PURPOSE.&nbsp;&nbsp;THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br/>
IS WITH YOU.&nbsp;&nbsp;SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE <a href="cost.htm">COST</a> OF<br/>
ALL NECESSARY <a href="serv.htm">SERV</a>ICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 16. Limitation of Liability.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br/>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br/>
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br/>
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br/>
<a href="use.htm">USE</a> OR INABILITY TO <a href="use.htm">USE</a> THE PROGRAM <small>(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br/>
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br/>
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS)</small>,<br/>
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br/>
SUCH DAMAGES.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br/>
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br/>
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br/>
an ab<a href="solu.htm">solu</a>te waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br/>
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br/>
copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; If you <a href="dev.htm">dev</a>elop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br/>
possible <a href="use.htm">use</a> to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br/>
<a href="free.htm">free</a> software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; To do so, attach the following notices to the program.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is safest<br/>
to attach them to the start of each <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e file to most effectively<br/>
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br/>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copyright <small>(C)</small> &lt;year>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;name of author><br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is <a href="free.htm">free</a> software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br/>

<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is distributed in the hope that it will be <a href="use.htm">use</a>ful,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp;&nbsp;See the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU Affero General Public License for more details.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; along with this program.&nbsp;&nbsp;If not, see &lt;<a class="ext" href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.</a><br/>
<br/>
Also add <a href="info.htm">info</a>rmation on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; If your software can interact with <a href="user.htm">user</a>s remotely through a computer<br/>
net<a href="work.htm">work</a>, you should also make sure that it provides a way for <a href="user.htm">user</a>s to<br/>
get its <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if your program is a web application, its<br/>
interface could display a "<a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e" link that leads <a href="user.htm">user</a>s to an archive<br/>
of the code.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many ways you could offer <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e, and different<br/>
<a href="solu.htm">solu</a>tions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the<br/>
specific requirements.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; You should also get your <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>er <small>(if you <a href="work.htm">work</a> as a programmer)</small> or school,<br/>
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br/>
