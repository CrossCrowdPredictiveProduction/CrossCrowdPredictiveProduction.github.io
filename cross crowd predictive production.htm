<br/>
<a href="cross crowd predictive production.htm">Cross Crowd Predictive Production</a> is a new business model that helps people share <a href="property.htm">property</a> and swap <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s for <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion under their full control and at the real cost of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
This approach requires a <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> operating under the constraints of the <a href="iota.htm">IOTA</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Investors commit <a href="property.htm">property</a>, <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s or <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> to receive <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>s which are a combination of real <a href="property.htm">property</a> ownership and <a href="work.htm">work</a> <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;They eventually receive <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts as the natural return from that <a href="property.htm">property</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike a traditional <a href="consume.htm">consume</a>r-cooperative, these <a href="consume.htm">consume</a>r/investors become *real* co-owners in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> and receive the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t as a natural side-effect of that ownership.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> does not 'pay' the investors with <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t; the owners of the <a href="source.htm">source</a>s own their portion of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts already, even before they is <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed.<br/>
<br/>
When you own an Apple tree, you own all the potential future Apples from that tree as a side-effect of owning the tree.&nbsp;&nbsp;You do not buy the Apples because they are your <a href="property.htm">property</a> already.<br/>
<br/>
When you own part of an Apple orchard in a <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>, you own your % of the Apples as a side-effect of owning a % of the orchard.&nbsp;&nbsp;You do not buy the Apples because they are your <a href="property.htm">property</a> already.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Prepaying with <a href="property.htm">Property</a></span><br/>
Investors may commit <a href="property.htm">property</a> directly or just pay with plain old <a href="money.htm">money</a> which will be used to buy <a href="property.htm">property</a>, both <a href="source.htm">source</a>s and 'startup' <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts to bootstrap the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Prepaying with <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s</span><br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers are also investors when the <a href="promise.htm">promise</a> to <a href="work.htm">work</a> in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Those who invest <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> also receive <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>s, just as every other investor.<br/>
<br/>
These investments are legally binding contracts to accomplish future goals for others within some time period.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Prepaying with <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a></span><br/>
<a href="consume.htm">Consume</a>rs are also investors when they pay <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> while buying <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a>.<br/>
<br/>
This only occurs when the <a href="consume.htm">consume</a>r has insufficient <a href="source.htm">source</a> ownership.<br/>
<br/>
This is a sort of 'accidental' investment caused by the payer's dependence upon the current owners.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==An Example</span><br/>
A <a href="work.htm">work</a>er may <a href="promise.htm">promise</a> to milk 100 cows each morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;This commitment is coupled with land, water-rights, tools and cattle to create a bundle of <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>s specific to cow milk.<br/>
<br/>
Each of these <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>s is sold to others within the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> that predict they will want milk.<br/>
<br/>
Some of these <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>s are sold for <a href="money.htm">money</a> to buy <a href="property.htm">property</a> such as land and tools and cattle, etc., while the rest are 'sold' to <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers in return for <a href="work.htm">work</a> <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="surplus.htm">Surplus</a> milk is sold to non-owners for a <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>, but the <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is treated as the payer's investment, causing those late-coming <a href="consume.htm">consume</a>rs to receive <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t Futures in the growth of the dairy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Rules of the <a href="iota.htm">IOTA</a></span><br/>
1. We use <a href="property.htm">property</a> ownership in the <a href="source.htm">source</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion to pre-allocate the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t to those who predict they will want it.<br/>
<br/>
And so there is no need to buy or sell <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts within the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> when those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts are already in the hands of those who will <a href="consume.htm">consume</a> them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, this also causes <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion to be strictly for use-value, and eliminates <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> naturally, except when selling <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a>, since the <a href="price.htm">price</a> they pay as <a href="consume.htm">consume</a>rs is exactly the costs they pay as owners.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2. We use <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s of <a href="work.htm">work</a> to schedule commitments of labor so that we do not need to pay wages in the traditional sense.<br/>
<br/>
For example, A commits to <a href="work.htm">work</a> for B in return for B committing to <a href="work.htm">work</a> for A.&nbsp;&nbsp;But a real <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing system would have at least dozens and probably hundreds of different <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts and so exchanges will be chained as A->B->C->D->E->A such that a <a href="work.htm">work</a>er can milk cattle and still have dental assurance even if the dentist is allergic to milk.<br/>
<br/>
Together, these minimize the need for token-passing within that <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> and creates real security for those participants.<br/>
<br/>
The only need for external <a href="money.htm">money</a> is further vertical integration as we incrementally purchase the entire tree of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion for each <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t we want.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3. After some time, owners will likely have <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a> <small>(especially after a few years of growth and natural regeneration of species)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
Each owner can choose to do whatever they like with their own <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a>, but if it is sold, the <a href="iota.htm">IOTA</a> requires <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> be treated as the payer's investment.<br/>
<br/>
Treating <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as the payer's investment auto-distributes control to those who pay for that growth.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
4. Any subgroup is allowed to split from the rest of the group for any reason while retaining their portion of ownership.&nbsp;&nbsp;This keeps control local as the form scales in total size and resolve devisive disputes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Example</span><br/>
Say you have ownership in the Olive orchard and find yourself with 100 extra pounds of Olives. You can turn these into oil and try to burn them in a diesel engine, or you can offer them as a sacrifice to your God, or whatever you want, but if you sell them, you must treat any a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> collected above costs as though the buyer had made an investment in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>.<br/>
<br/>
If you do all of the <a href="work.htm">work</a> of selling the Olives, then you can claim that everything the buyer paid beyond any other costs you may have incurred are your wages for doing that <a href="work.htm">work</a> or you can arbitrarily mark some of that as <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> since you are not using the market to determine your wages.<br/>
<br/>
But if you hire someone to sell the Olives, or <small>(and this next case will likely be the most common)</small> if you just let the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> storehouse sell any of your <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a> for you, then those <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers will be paid wages that are easily separated from <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s, and so all you will receive all the costs needed to cover that over<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion <small>(assuming the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t can be sold at least at cost)</small> and so you will "break even" but will never "make a <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>" because all the <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> will be treated as though the person who paid it was making an investment.<br/>
<br/>
This means you will want to own just barely enough of each part of the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> as you need of each <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t; though actually you will likely want to own just a little bit more as a sort of 'insurance' against the possibility lean years of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion caused by drought or pestilence, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==</span><br/>
Imagine a <a href="crowd.htm">crowd</a>-funded corporation where the only shareholders are the very <a href="consume.htm">consume</a>rs of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t and their ROI is the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t itself.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of collecting <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> from others, they avoid paying <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> themselves.<br/>
<br/>
The owner of an Apple tree does not *buy* the Apples from himself, but owns them already, as a side-effect of his <a href="property.htm">property</a> ownership.<br/>
<br/>
In <a href="ccpp.htm">CCPP</a>, the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is not be sold back to each owner; it is their <a href="property.htm">property</a> already, according to the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of <a href="source.htm">source</a>s they own.<br/>
<br/>
If you invest more than you can use directly, you can sell that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t to others under the strict condition <small>(enforced by the <a href="iota.htm">IOTA</a>)</small> that any <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> collected during that sale be treated as an investment from that payer - so the organization can grow in size while avoiding the troubles of centralization and overaccumulation that plague nearly every other endeavor that begins to scale.<br/>
<br/>
There is no reason to worry about the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers - for that is who we are protecting, but we are protecting their ability to <a href="consume.htm">consume</a> instead of trying to prop-up wages and avoid automation.<br/>
<br/>
Wishing the machines would just stop <small>(as John Henry)</small> will become less and less of an option as the robots are coming to take the <a href="work.htm">work</a> away - and we can be *happy* about that if we are <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing on the right side of the equation!<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, even without robots, wages and <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> will approach zero as the <a href="source.htm">source</a>s become cheaper, since there will be no way to stop willing <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers from accessing those tools and thereby providing the solutions <a href="consume.htm">consume</a>rs seek.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers can invest more than they are able to <a href="consume.htm">consume</a>, but it won't do them any good when the <a href="consume.htm">consume</a>rs already have sufficient ownership needed to protect themselves from <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers who try to stop other peers from doing that <a href="work.htm">work</a> by blocking access to <a href="property.htm">property</a> needed for <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers cannot inflate wages through ownership if other <a href="consume.htm">consume</a>rs already have sufficient ownership because propping wages requires the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er be able to stop other potential <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers from accessing the <a href="property.htm">property</a>, and why would a group stop a peer from bidding to do a job especially since in some cases they might even do that <a href="work.htm">work</a> for <a href="free.htm">free</a> <small>(gratis)</small> because they see it as play.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers who invest and co-own more of the Avocado orchard than they are able to <a href="consume.htm">consume</a> will not be able to prop-up wages because the other co-owners will always have the option to do the <a href="work.htm">work</a> for themselves or to hire the lowest bidder.<br/>
<br/>
When those <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers have sufficient ownership in the <a href="source.htm">source</a>s for which they need the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts, they will not be buying <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts from anyone, but will own them already, as a side-effect of their owning the <a href="source.htm">source</a>s needed for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
You may be tempted to dismiss this as simply a <a href="consume.htm">Consume</a>r Cooperative, but this is absolutely NOT a <a href="consume.htm">Consume</a>r Cooperative.<br/>
<br/>
1.)</small> <a href="consume.htm">Consume</a>r Cooperatives *sell* the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t back to the co-owners and collect a <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> during that transaction that a committee then doles out in a Tyranny of the Majority fashion.<br/>
<br/>
1a.)</small> <a href="ccpp.htm">CCPP</a> only sells <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t to non-owners, and only when there is <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a>, and treats that <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as an investment from that payer - causing ownership and control to be automatically distributed at the point of sale back to the actor who was willing to pay for it. This system minimizes and nearly eliminates the trading of goods since the <a href="property.htm">Property</a> owner of does not buy the Objective, but owns it already as a result of his <a href="property.htm">Property</a> ownership.&nbsp;&nbsp;The trading of goods will tend toward zero but does not reach stasis because of newcomers into the system <small>(even just babies being born)</small>, and because people's interests change across time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> <a href="consume.htm">Consume</a>r Cooperatives are "Democratically Controlled" with one-member/one-vote.<br/>
<br/>
2a.)</small> <a href="ccpp.htm">CCPP</a> is far more autarchic - where any member can 'fork' his portion of the <a href="property.htm">Property</a> and secede from the union or sell those shares if a split is attempted that is finer than reasonable divisibility <small>(you can't both feed a single milk-cow grain and NOT feed that cow grain, but can divide a herd)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
2b.)</small> Each member has exactly as much vote power as he has ownership. If you own 11% of a roto-tiller and your neighbor owns 22%, then you have only half as much vote power in decisions such as "how often should we change the oil".<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3.)</small> Every <a href="consume.htm">Consume</a>r Cooperative I know of is only concerned with buying <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts that were made by Capitalists.<br/>
<br/>
3a.)</small> <a href="ccpp.htm">CCPP</a> is primarily about ownership and control of the entire tree of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion - recursively, and <a href="work.htm">work</a>s toward a Vertically Integrated Commons where we, the people, own the farms and factories and land and water rights and all the other <a href="property.htm">Property</a> and supporting <a href="property.htm">Property</a> required to re<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e those things.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Customers *already* pay all the Costs of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion. We, the <a href="consume.htm">consume</a>rs, foot the entire bill. And we *also* pay <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> because we choose to pay late.<br/>
<br/>
But if we could organize to pay early - to collectively purchase the <a href="property.htm">Property</a> needed to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts we need - then, we would still need to pay all costs.<br/>
<br/>
But since we would own the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts as a side-effect of our owning the <a href="source.htm">source</a>s, we would not be 'buying' from ourselves, and so COULD NOT pay <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>, for that final transaction would not even occur!<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is *undefined* when the <a href="consume.htm">consume</a>rs own the <a href="source.htm">source</a>s and accept the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t as ROI.<br/>
<br/>
Treating <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as the payer's investment allows us to safely include others while avoiding the typical problems of overaccumulation and excessive concentration of control that cause even the most well-intentioned organizations to finally fail to meet the needs of those they were initially formed to serve.<br/>
<br/>
These owners do not buy the finished <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts, but own them already - even before they are completed - as a side-effect of their <a href="source.htm">source</a> ownership.<br/>
<br/>
1.)</small> Since the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is not sold, <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> does not exist.<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> Since the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is not sold, there is no chance for the government to collect sales tax.<br/>
<br/>
3.)</small> Since the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is not sold, there is no chance for the government to disallow that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion <small>(buying raw milk is illegal in many parts of the US)</small>.<br/>
