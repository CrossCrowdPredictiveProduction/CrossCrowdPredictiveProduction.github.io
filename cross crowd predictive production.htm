<br/>
<a href="cross crowd predictive production.htm">Cross Crowd Predictive Production</a> is a new business model that helps groups share <a href="property.htm">Property</a> and swap <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s for <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion under their full control and at no more than real costs of <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Bootup</span><br/>
Estimate the quantity and quality food, housing, sanitation, clothing, basic health-care, child care, transportation, etc. needed to support on-site workers.<br/>
<br/>
Estimate the <a href="property.htm">Property</a> and <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s needed for that <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion and issue <a href="product future.htm">Product Future</a>s toward those goals.<br/>
<br/>
Sell those <a href="product future.htm">Product Future</a>s to consumers <small>(for <a href="money.htm">money</a> used to buy <a href="property.htm">Property</a>)</small> and workers <small>(for <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s of <a href="future.htm">future</a> work)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
Part of this <a href="money.htm">money</a> is used to buy the <a href="property.htm">Property</a> portions of <a href="product future.htm">Product Future</a>s such as land, tools, organisms, lumber, wire, pipe, etc. needed to build the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The rest of the <a href="money.htm">money</a> is used to buy 'bootup' <a href="property.htm">Property</a> such as tents, bulk-food, used clothing, etc. needed to support workers until the agriculture is <a href="product.htm">product</a>ive and before the permanent shelters are complete; and also to cover external services such as dental-care, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Once we have the land, tools and bootup goods, the workers begin installing the agriculture and building the first of the shared structures.<br/>
<br/>
These workers look at the list of work needed and signup to fulfill the '<a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s' portion of some <a href="product future.htm">Product Future</a>s for which they have skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are 'paid' not with <a href="money.htm">money</a>, but by receiving <a href="product future.htm">Product Future</a>s representing the <a href="property.htm">Property</a> and <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s needed to produce the goods and services they need and, initially, by also receiving a portion of the bootup goods and external services needed until we are fully bootstrapped.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone holding a <a href="product future.htm">Product Future</a> must pay the recurring costs of <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion with either <a href="property.htm">Property</a> or <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s else their <a href="property.htm">Property</a> portion of that <a href="product future.htm">Product Future</a> will be incrementally sold to cover those costs.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="product.htm">Product</a> is the 'natural' return to <a href="property.htm">Property</a> owners.&nbsp;&nbsp;You don't buy Avocados when you own part of the tree; you own that fruit already!<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="price.htm">price</a> each consumer pays is exactly the costs they each paid as a co-owner and so <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> does not exist because the <a href="product.htm">Product</a> is never sold <small>(except when selling <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a>)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Paying Consumers</span><br/>
Consumers who invest <a href="money.htm">money</a> in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> receive <a href="product future.htm">Product Future</a>s which are a combination of real <a href="property.htm">Property</a> ownership and work <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;They receive <a href="product.htm">Product</a> as a natural return on those commitments.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike a traditional consumer-cooperative, these consumer/investors become *real* co-owners in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> and receive the <a href="product.htm">Product</a> as a natural side-effect of that ownership.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> does not 'pay' the investors with <a href="product.htm">Product</a>; the investors are owners that own the <a href="product.htm">Product</a> already, even before it is produced!<br/>
<br/>
For example, when you own an Apple tree, you own all the potential <a href="future.htm">future</a> Apples from that tree as a side-effect of owning the tree.&nbsp;&nbsp;You do not buy the Apples because they are your <a href="property.htm">Property</a> already.<br/>
<br/>
When you own part of an Apple orchard in a <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>, you own your % of the Apples as a side-effect of owning a % of the orchard.&nbsp;&nbsp;You do not buy the Apples because they are your <a href="property.htm">Property</a> already.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Paying Workers</span><br/>
Workers are also consumers.<br/>
<br/>
Consumers who invest work <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> receive <a href="product future.htm">Product Future</a>s which are a combination of real <a href="property.htm">Property</a> ownership and work <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;They receive <a href="product.htm">Product</a> as a natural return on those commitments.<br/>
<br/>
These consumer/workers invest <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s by signing "work bonds" that are legally binding commitments to achive goals for others within some time period.<br/>
<br/>
For example, a worker may commit to milk 100 cows each morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;This commitment is coupled with land, tools and cattle to create a bundle of <a href="property.htm">Property</a> <a href="future.htm">Future</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
Each of these <a href="property.htm">Property</a> <a href="future.htm">Future</a>s is sold to others participating in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> that predict they will want milk.<br/>
<br/>
Some of these <a href="property.htm">Property</a> <a href="future.htm">Future</a>s must be sold for <a href="money.htm">money</a> to buy the land and tools and cattle, while the rest must be sold for work <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
Once all the <a href="property.htm">Property</a> <a href="future.htm">Future</a>s are sold, the <a href="money.htm">money</a> is used to buy the land, tools and cattle, and <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion can begin!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==<a href="surplus.htm">Surplus</a> and Growth</span><br/>
As the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> becomes to <a href="product.htm">product</a>ive, most of the <a href="product.htm">Product</a> is not sold, but is already the <a href="property.htm">Property</a> of each investor according to the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> they own.<br/>
<br/>
After some time, owners will likely have <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a> <small>(especially after a few years of growth and natural regeneration of species)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
Each owner can choose to do whatever they like with their own <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a>, but if it is sold, the <a href="iota.htm">IOTA</a> requires any <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> be treated as the Payer's Investment.<br/>
<br/>
Treating <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as the payer's investment autodistributes control to those who pay for that growth.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Summary</span><br/>
We use <a href="property.htm">Property</a> ownership in the Sources of <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion to pre-allocate the <a href="product.htm">Product</a> to those who predict they will want it.<br/>
<br/>
And so there is no need to buy or sell <a href="product.htm">Product</a>s within the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> because those <a href="product.htm">Product</a>s are already in the hands of those who will consume them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, this also causes <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion to be strictly for use-value, and eliminates <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> completely except when selling <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a> since the <a href="price.htm">price</a> they pay as consumers is exactly the costs they pay as owners.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We use work <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s to schedule commitments of labor so that we do not need to pay wages in the traditional sense.<br/>
<br/>
For example, A commits to work for B in return for B committing to work for A.&nbsp;&nbsp;But a real working system would have at least dozens and probably hundreds of different <a href="product.htm">Product</a>s and so exchanges will be chained as A->B->C->D->E->A such that a worker can milk cattle and still have dental assurance even if the dentist is allergic to milk.<br/>
<br/>
This minimizes the need for token-passing within that <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> and creates real security for those participants.<br/>
<br/>
The only need for external <a href="money.htm">money</a> is further vertical integration as we incrementally purchase the entire tree of <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion for each <a href="product.htm">Product</a> we want.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Example</span><br/>
Say you have ownership in the Olive orchard and find yourself with 100 extra pounds of Olives. You can turn these into oil and try to burn them in a diesel engine, or you can offer them as a sacrifice to your God, or whatever you want, but if you sell them, you must treat any a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> collected above costs as though the buyer had made an investment in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>.<br/>
<br/>
If you do all of the work of selling the Olives, then you can claim that everything the buyer paid beyond any other costs you may have incurred are your wages for doing that work or you can arbitrarily mark some of that as <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> since you are not using the market to determine your wages.<br/>
<br/>
But if you hire someone to sell the Olives, or <small>(and this next case will likely be the most common)</small> if you just let the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> storehouse sell any of your <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a> for you, then those workers will be paid wages that are easily separated from <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s, and so all you will receive all the costs needed to cover that over<a href="product.htm">product</a>ion <small>(assuming the <a href="product.htm">Product</a> can be sold at least at cost)</small> and so you will "break even" but will never "make a <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>" because all the <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> will be treated as though the person who paid it was making an investment.<br/>
<br/>
This means you will want to own just barely enough of each part of the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> as you need of each <a href="product.htm">Product</a>; though actually you will likely want to own just a little bit more as a sort of 'insurance' against the possibility lean years of <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion caused by drought or pestilence, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Another Explanation</span><br/>
We can produce the goods and services we know we will need on a recurring and continual basis such as food, water, housing, health-care, transportation, etc. without paying <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> or rent or interest to others.<br/>
<br/>
First we create 'core' businesses that are each co-owned by the <a href="future.htm">future</a> customers of that very <a href="product.htm">Product</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, a chicken farm and tools for those who want eggs, a dental office and tools for those who want to insure their teeth will be fixed, a barley field and hops field and a brewery and tools for those who want beer, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;We can most likely use <a href="crowd.htm">crowd</a>-funding to start for each of these with the 'perk' being real co-ownership in that enterprise.<br/>
<br/>
By creating a variety of these core businesses to cover each need we have, we will also be able to swap skills <small>(exchange <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s to work)</small> and thereby also eliminate the payment of wages in the traditional sense.<br/>
<br/>
Each core business will not be <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>able at first simply because we will not be selling the <a href="product.htm">Product</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each co-owner owns his portion of the <a href="product.htm">Product</a>s <small>(eggs or fixed teeth or beer)</small> as a result of his paying his portion of the costs of <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion.<br/>
<br/>
This may seem useless, but is actually very valuable because it creates a solid foundation for the efficiency of scale we need to compete with traditional businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;These customer/owners will rarely leave because it is impossible to get the <a href="product.htm">Product</a> for less than the real costs of <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion.<br/>
<br/>
Once each core is full operational, we begin selling <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a> to outsiders and charging <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> against them.&nbsp;&nbsp;This will cause the core to grow in size.<br/>
<br/>
If we want the cores to remain stable as they scale, we will need to treat some % of the <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as an investment from the payer so that all consumers incrementally gain the co-ownership needed to receive that <a href="product.htm">Product</a> in the <a href="future.htm">future</a> at the real costs of <a href="product.htm">product</a>ion.<br/>
