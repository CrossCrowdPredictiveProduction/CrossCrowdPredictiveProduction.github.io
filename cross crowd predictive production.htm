<br/>
<a href="cross crowd predictive production.htm">Cross Crowd Predictive Production</a> is a new business model that helps people share <a href="property.htm">property</a> and swap <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s for <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion under their full control and at the real cost of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
This approach requires a <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> operating under the constraints of the <a href="iota.htm">IOTA</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Investment</span><br/>
Those who invest <a href="property.htm">property</a> in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> receive <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t Futures which are a combination of real <a href="property.htm">property</a> ownership and work <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;They receive <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t as a natural return from that <a href="property.htm">property</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike a traditional consumer-cooperative, these consumer/investors become *real* co-owners in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> and receive the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t as a natural side-effect of that ownership.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> does not 'pay' the investors with <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t; the owners of the <a href="source.htm">source</a>s own their portion of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts already, even before they is <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed.<br/>
<br/>
For example, when you own an Apple tree, you own all the potential future Apples from that tree as a side-effect of owning the tree.&nbsp;&nbsp;You do not buy the Apples because they are your <a href="property.htm">property</a> already.<br/>
<br/>
When you own part of an Apple orchard in a <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>, you own your % of the Apples as a side-effect of owning a % of the orchard.&nbsp;&nbsp;You do not buy the Apples because they are your <a href="property.htm">property</a> already.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Prepaying with <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s</span><br/>
Workers are also consumers.<br/>
<br/>
Those who invest <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> receive <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t Futures which are a combination of real <a href="property.htm">property</a> ownership and work <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;They receive <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t as a natural return from that <a href="property.htm">property</a>.<br/>
<br/>
These investments are <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s of future work recorded by signing "work bonds" that are legally binding commitments to achive goals for others within some time period.<br/>
<br/>
For example, a worker may commit to milk 100 cows each morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;This commitment is coupled with land, water-rights, tools and cattle to create a bundle of <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
Each of these <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>s is sold to others participating in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> that predict they will want milk.<br/>
<br/>
Some of these <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>s must be sold for <a href="money.htm">money</a> to buy <a href="property.htm">property</a> such as land and tools and cattle, while the rest must be sold for work <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1. We use <a href="property.htm">property</a> ownership in the <a href="source.htm">Source</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion to pre-allocate the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t to those who predict they will want it.<br/>
<br/>
And so there is no need to buy or sell <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts within the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> because those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts are already in the hands of those who will consume them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, this also causes <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion to be strictly for use-value, and eliminates <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> completely except when selling <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a> since the <a href="price.htm">price</a> they pay as consumers is exactly the costs they pay as owners.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2. We use work <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s to schedule commitments of labor so that we do not need to pay wages in the traditional sense.<br/>
<br/>
For example, A commits to work for B in return for B committing to work for A.&nbsp;&nbsp;But a real working system would have at least dozens and probably hundreds of different <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts and so exchanges will be chained as A->B->C->D->E->A such that a worker can milk cattle and still have dental assurance even if the dentist is allergic to milk.<br/>
<br/>
This minimizes the need for token-passing within that <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> and creates real security for those participants.<br/>
<br/>
The only need for external <a href="money.htm">money</a> is further vertical integration as we incrementally purchase the entire tree of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion for each <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t we want.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3. After some time, owners will likely have <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a> <small>(especially after a few years of growth and natural regeneration of species)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
Each owner can choose to do whatever they like with their own <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a>, but if it is sold, the <a href="iota.htm">IOTA</a> requires <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> be treated as the payer's investment.<br/>
<br/>
Treating <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as the payer's investment auto-distributes control to those who pay for that growth.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Example</span><br/>
Say you have ownership in the Olive orchard and find yourself with 100 extra pounds of Olives. You can turn these into oil and try to burn them in a diesel engine, or you can offer them as a sacrifice to your God, or whatever you want, but if you sell them, you must treat any a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> collected above costs as though the buyer had made an investment in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>.<br/>
<br/>
If you do all of the work of selling the Olives, then you can claim that everything the buyer paid beyond any other costs you may have incurred are your wages for doing that work or you can arbitrarily mark some of that as <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> since you are not using the market to determine your wages.<br/>
<br/>
But if you hire someone to sell the Olives, or <small>(and this next case will likely be the most common)</small> if you just let the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> storehouse sell any of your <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a> for you, then those workers will be paid wages that are easily separated from <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s, and so all you will receive all the costs needed to cover that over<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion <small>(assuming the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t can be sold at least at cost)</small> and so you will "break even" but will never "make a <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>" because all the <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> will be treated as though the person who paid it was making an investment.<br/>
<br/>
This means you will want to own just barely enough of each part of the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> as you need of each <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t; though actually you will likely want to own just a little bit more as a sort of 'insurance' against the possibility lean years of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion caused by drought or pestilence, etc.<br/>
