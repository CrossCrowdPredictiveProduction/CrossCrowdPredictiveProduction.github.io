<br/>
<a href="cross crowd predictive production.htm">Cross Crowd Predictive Production</a> is a new business model that helps people share <a href="property.htm">property</a> and swap <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s for <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion under their full control and at the real cost of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
This approach requires a <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> operating under the constraints of the <a href="iota.htm">IOTA</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Prepaying with <a href="property.htm">Property</a></span><br/>
Investments of <a href="money.htm">money</a> are used to buy <a href="property.htm">property</a>, both <a href="source.htm">source</a>s and 'startup' <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts to bootstrap the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Investors receive <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>s which are a combination of real <a href="property.htm">property</a> ownership and <a href="work.htm">work</a> <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;They eventually receive <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts as the natural return from that <a href="property.htm">property</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike a traditional <a href="consume.htm">consume</a>r-cooperative, these <a href="consume.htm">consume</a>r/investors become *real* co-owners in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> and receive the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t as a natural side-effect of that ownership.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> does not 'pay' the investors with <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t; the owners of the <a href="source.htm">source</a>s own their portion of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts already, even before they is <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed.<br/>
<br/>
For example, when you own an Apple tree, you own all the potential future Apples from that tree as a side-effect of owning the tree.&nbsp;&nbsp;You do not buy the Apples because they are your <a href="property.htm">property</a> already.<br/>
<br/>
When you own part of an Apple orchard in a <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>, you own your % of the Apples as a side-effect of owning a % of the orchard.&nbsp;&nbsp;You do not buy the Apples because they are your <a href="property.htm">property</a> already.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Prepaying with <a href="promise.htm">Promise</a>s</span><br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers are also <a href="consume.htm">consume</a>rs.<br/>
<br/>
Those who invest <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> also receive <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>s, just as every other investor.<br/>
<br/>
These investments are legally binding contracts to accomplish future goals for others within some time period.<br/>
<br/>
For example, a <a href="work.htm">work</a>er may commit to milk 100 cows each morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;This commitment is coupled with land, water-rights, tools and cattle to create a bundle of <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>s specific to cow milk.<br/>
<br/>
Each of these <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>s is sold to others participating in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> that predict they will want milk.<br/>
<br/>
Some of these <a href="property future.htm">Property Future</a>s are sold for <a href="money.htm">money</a> to buy <a href="property.htm">property</a> such as land and tools and cattle, etc., while the rest are 'sold' to <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers in return for <a href="work.htm">work</a> <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1. We use <a href="property.htm">property</a> ownership in the <a href="source.htm">source</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion to pre-allocate the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t to those who predict they will want it.<br/>
<br/>
And so there is no need to buy or sell <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts within the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> because those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts are already in the hands of those who will <a href="consume.htm">consume</a> them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, this also causes <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion to be strictly for use-value, and eliminates <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> completely except when selling <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a> since the <a href="price.htm">price</a> they pay as <a href="consume.htm">consume</a>rs is exactly the costs they pay as owners.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2. We use <a href="promise.htm">promise</a>s of <a href="work.htm">work</a> to schedule commitments of labor so that we do not need to pay wages in the traditional sense.<br/>
<br/>
For example, A commits to <a href="work.htm">work</a> for B in return for B committing to <a href="work.htm">work</a> for A.&nbsp;&nbsp;But a real <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing system would have at least dozens and probably hundreds of different <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts and so exchanges will be chained as A->B->C->D->E->A such that a <a href="work.htm">work</a>er can milk cattle and still have dental assurance even if the dentist is allergic to milk.<br/>
<br/>
Together, these minimize the need for token-passing within that <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> and creates real security for those participants.<br/>
<br/>
The only need for external <a href="money.htm">money</a> is further vertical integration as we incrementally purchase the entire tree of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion for each <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t we want.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3. After some time, owners will likely have <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a> <small>(especially after a few years of growth and natural regeneration of species)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
Each owner can choose to do whatever they like with their own <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a>, but if it is sold, the <a href="iota.htm">IOTA</a> requires <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> be treated as the payer's investment.<br/>
<br/>
Treating <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as the payer's investment auto-distributes control to those who pay for that growth.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
4. Any subgroup is allowed to split from the rest of the group for any reason while retaining their portion of ownership.&nbsp;&nbsp;This keeps control local as the form scales in total size and resolve devisive disputes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Example</span><br/>
Say you have ownership in the Olive orchard and find yourself with 100 extra pounds of Olives. You can turn these into oil and try to burn them in a diesel engine, or you can offer them as a sacrifice to your God, or whatever you want, but if you sell them, you must treat any a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> collected above costs as though the buyer had made an investment in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>.<br/>
<br/>
If you do all of the <a href="work.htm">work</a> of selling the Olives, then you can claim that everything the buyer paid beyond any other costs you may have incurred are your wages for doing that <a href="work.htm">work</a> or you can arbitrarily mark some of that as <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> since you are not using the market to determine your wages.<br/>
<br/>
But if you hire someone to sell the Olives, or <small>(and this next case will likely be the most common)</small> if you just let the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> storehouse sell any of your <a href="surplus.htm">surplus</a> for you, then those <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers will be paid wages that are easily separated from <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s, and so all you will receive all the costs needed to cover that over<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion <small>(assuming the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t can be sold at least at cost)</small> and so you will "break even" but will never "make a <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>" because all the <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> will be treated as though the person who paid it was making an investment.<br/>
<br/>
This means you will want to own just barely enough of each part of the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> as you need of each <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t; though actually you will likely want to own just a little bit more as a sort of 'insurance' against the possibility lean years of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion caused by drought or pestilence, etc.<br/>
