The U.S. Is Facing a Cheese Overload<br/>
Jonathan Chew<br/>
Apr 29, 2016<br/>
The U.S. will not be running out of cheese any<a href="time.htm">time</a> soon, as inventories are at their highest levels in 32 years.<br/>
That's according to the <a href="late.htm">late</a>st <a href="data.htm">data</a> collected by the U.S. De<a href="part.htm">part</a>ment of <a href="agri.htm">Agri</a>culture, which show cheese stockpiles in March were the highest for the period since 1984. More than half of it was made up of American cheese, re<a href="port.htm">port</a>ed Bloomberg, while Swiss cheese stands at about 2%, and the rest is labelled as "other."<br/>
The reason lies a<a href="cross.htm">cross</a> the Atlantic Ocean. Dairy <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t ex<a href="port.htm">port</a>s from Europe have been increasing over the last two years, and cheese <a href="price.htm">price</a>s have been steadily falling in tandem. The result is a global oversupply in milk and dairy <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts.<br/>
That <a href="means.htm">means</a> the U.S have taken advantage of dropping <a href="price.htm">price</a>s and the weakening euro to <a href="buy.htm">buy</a> up more European-made cheese—im<a href="port.htm">port</a>s of EU cheese rose 17% last year, re<a href="port.htm">port</a>ed Bloomberg, and combined with an over<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion of milk by America <a href="farm.htm">farm</a>ers to combat similarly low <a href="price.htm">price</a>s, and it has resulted in extra cheese.<br/>
"It's been difficult for them <small>[U.S.]</small> to ex<a href="port.htm">port</a>, given the strong dollar, and they're sucking in im<a href="port.htm">port</a>s," Kevin Bellamy, a global dairy market strategist at Rabobank International, told Bloomberg. “Where the U.S. has lost out on business, Europe has gained.”<br/>
The worldwide glut in milk, however, is hitting European <a href="farm.htm">farm</a>s hard. Dairy <a href="farm.htm">farm</a>ers from Germany to Ire<a href="land.htm">land</a> are facing huge losses from low <a href="price.htm">price</a>s, and the European Milk Board has called for EU policy-<a href="make.htm">make</a>rs to set up an effective program that will restrain milk <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion in <a href="exch.htm">exch</a>ange for financial compensation."The deficit situation will continue, with the only increases being in <a href="debt.htm">debt</a>s and number of <a href="farm.htm">farm</a>s closing, but not in urgently <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed in<a href="vest.htm">vest</a>ments in <a href="farm.htm">farm</a>s," said Romuald Schaber, president of the European Milk Board, as re<a href="port.htm">port</a>ed by Dairy Re<a href="port.htm">port</a>er.<br/>

<br/>
To answer questions of how this concept might extended to the goals of an LVT <a href="game.htm">Game</a> implementation:<br/>
<br/>
1. I<a href="magi.htm">magi</a>ne each <a href="cell.htm">cell</a> in the <a href="grid.htm">grid</a> represents 1 square foot of <a href="land.htm">Land</a>.<br/>
<br/>
2. <a href="inst.htm">Inst</a>ead <a href="play.htm">play</a>ers choosing one of 16 colors for each <a href="cell.htm">cell</a>, they <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ead choose to apply various <a href="type.htm">type</a>s of <a href="capital.htm">Capital</a>, such as <a href="part.htm">part</a> of a wheat field, <a href="part.htm">part</a> of flour mill, <a href="part.htm">part</a> of a bakery, <a href="part.htm">part</a> of a road, <a href="part.htm">part</a> of a house, etc.<br/>
<br/>
3. There <a href="must.htm">must</a> also be a way to represent the <a href="labor.htm">Labor</a> <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed to accomplish those goals for each <a href="cell.htm">cell</a>.<br/>
<br/>
4. There <a href="must.htm">must</a> be a way to draw borders - similar to how <a href="we.htm">we</a> <a href="use.htm">use</a> <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty rights in the real world, but maybe not necessarily using <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itional <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>
<br/>
5. A way to enforce these borders throug an internal system of '<a href="law.htm">law</a>', including cops and jails, etc., though I think it might be best to allow the <a href="play.htm">play</a>ers to <a href="creat.htm">creat</a>e that <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the system themselves <a href="inst.htm">inst</a>ead of imposing it <small>[but am still unsure on this <a href="point.htm">point</a>]</small>.<br/>
